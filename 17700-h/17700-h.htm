<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>


<p>This monograph was begun during my residence as
Rogers Memorial Fellow at Harvard University, and is
based mainly upon a study of the sources, i.e., national,
State, and colonial statutes, Congressional documents, reports
of societies, personal narratives, etc. The collection of laws
available for this research was, I think, nearly complete; on
the other hand, facts and statistics bearing on the economic
side of the study have been difficult to find, and my conclusions
are consequently liable to modification from this source.</p>

<p>The question of the suppression of the slave-trade is so intimately
connected with the questions as to its rise, the system
of American slavery, and the whole colonial policy of the
eighteenth century, that it is difficult to isolate it, and at the
same time to avoid superficiality on the one hand, and unscientific
narrowness of view on the other. While I could not
hope entirely to overcome such a difficulty, I nevertheless
trust that I have succeeded in rendering this monograph a
small contribution to the scientific study of slavery and the
American Negro.</p>

<p>I desire to express my obligation to Dr. Albert Bushnell
Hart, of Harvard University, at whose suggestion I began this
work and by whose kind aid and encouragement I have
brought it to a close; also I have to thank the trustees of the
John F. Slater Fund, whose appointment made it possible to
test the conclusions of this study by the general principles laid
down in German universities.</p>

<p>1. <b>Plan of the Monograph.</b> This monograph proposes to set
forth the efforts made in the United States of America, from
early colonial times until the present, to limit and suppress
the trade in slaves between Africa and these shores.</p>

<p>The study begins with the colonial period, setting forth in
brief the attitude of England and, more in detail, the attitude
of the planting, farming, and trading groups of colonies
toward the slave-trade. It deals next with the first concerted
effort against the trade and with the further action of the
individual States. The important work of the Constitutional
Convention follows, together with the history of the trade in
that critical period which preceded the Act of 1807. The
attempt to suppress the trade from 1807 to 1830 is next
recounted. A chapter then deals with the slave-trade as an
international problem. Finally the development of the crises
up to the Civil War is studied, together with the steps leading
to the final suppression; and a concluding chapter seeks to

<p>2. <b>The Rise of the English Slave-Trade.</b> Any attempt to
consider the attitude of the English colonies toward the African
slave-trade must be prefaced by a word as to the attitude
of England herself and the development of the trade in her
hands.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Sir John Hawkins's celebrated voyage took place in 1562,
but probably not until 1631<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> did a regular chartered company
<!-- Page 10 --><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum">10</span>undertake to carry on the trade.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> This company was unsuccessful,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and was eventually succeeded by the "Company of
Royal Adventurers trading to Africa," chartered by Charles II.
in 1662, and including the Queen Dowager and the Duke of
York.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The company contracted to supply the West Indies
with three thousand slaves annually; but contraband trade,
misconduct, and war so reduced it that in 1672 it surrendered
its charter to another company for &pound;34,000.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> This new corporation,
chartered by Charles II. as the "Royal African Company,"
proved more successful than its predecessors, and
carried on a growing trade for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>In 1698 Parliamentary interference with the trade began. By
the Statute 9 and 10 William and Mary, chapter 26, private
traders, on payment of a duty of 10% on English goods exported
to Africa, were allowed to participate in the trade.
This was brought about by the clamor of the merchants, especially
the "American Merchants," who "in their Petition
suggest, that it would be a great Benefit to the Kingdom to
secure the Trade by maintaining Forts and Castles there, with
an equal Duty upon all Goods exported."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This plan, being a
compromise between maintaining the monopoly intact and
entirely abolishing it, was adopted, and the statute declared
the trade "highly Beneficial and Advantageous to this Kingdom,
and to the Plantations and Colonies thereunto belonging."</p>

<p>Having thus gained practically free admittance to the field,
English merchants sought to exclude other nations by securing
a monopoly of the lucrative Spanish colonial slave-trade.<!-- Page 11 --><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">11</span>
Their object was finally accomplished by the signing of the
Assiento in 1713.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The Assiento was a treaty between England and Spain by
which the latter granted the former a monopoly of the Spanish
colonial slave-trade for thirty years, and England engaged
to supply the colonies within that time with at least 144,000
slaves, at the rate of 4,800 per year. England was also to advance
Spain 200,000 crowns, and to pay a duty of 33&frac12; crowns
for each slave imported. The kings of Spain and England
were each to receive one-fourth of the profits of the trade,
and the Royal African Company were authorized to import
as many slaves as they wished above the specified number in
the first twenty-five years, and to sell them, except in three
ports, at any price they could get.</p>

<p>It is stated that, in the twenty years from 1713 to 1733, fifteen
thousand slaves were annually imported into America by the
English, of whom from one-third to one-half went to the
Spanish colonies.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> To the company itself the venture proved
a financial failure; for during the years 1729&ndash;1750 Parliament
assisted the Royal Company by annual grants which
amounted to &pound;90,000,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and by 1739 Spain was a creditor to
the extent of &pound;68,000, and threatened to suspend the treaty.
The war interrupted the carrying out of the contract, but the
Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle extended the limit by four years.
Finally, October 5, 1750, this privilege was waived for a money
consideration paid to England; the Assiento was ended, and
the Royal Company was bankrupt.</p>

<p>By the Statute 23 George II., chapter 31, the old company
was dissolved and a new "Company of Merchants trading to
Africa" erected in its stead.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Any merchant so desiring was
allowed to engage in the trade on payment of certain small
duties, and such merchants formed a company headed by nine
directors. This marked the total abolition of monopoly in the
<!-- Page 12 --><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum">12</span>slave-trade, and was the form under which the trade was carried
on until after the American Revolution.</p>

<p>That the slave-trade was the very life of the colonies had,
by 1700, become an almost unquestioned axiom in British
practical economics. The colonists themselves declared slaves
"the strength and sinews of this western world,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and the
lack of them "the grand obstruction"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> here, as the settlements
"cannot subsist without supplies of them."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Thus,
with merchants clamoring at home and planters abroad, it
easily became the settled policy of England to encourage the
slave-trade. Then, too, she readily argued that what was an
economic necessity in Jamaica and the Barbadoes could
scarcely be disadvantageous to Carolina, Virginia, or even
New York. Consequently, the colonial governors were generally
instructed to "give all due encouragement and invitation
to merchants and others, ... and in particular to the
royal African company of England."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Duties laid on the importer,
and all acts in any way restricting the trade, were
frowned upon and very often disallowed. "Whereas," ran
Governor Dobbs's instructions, "Acts have been passed in
some of our Plantations in America for laying duties on the
importation and exportation of Negroes to the great discouragement
of the Merchants trading thither from the
coast of Africa.... It is our Will and Pleasure that you
do not give your assent to or pass any Law imposing
duties upon Negroes imported into our Province of North
Carolina."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The exact proportions of the slave-trade to America can be
but approximately determined. From 1680 to 1688 the African
Company sent 249 ships to Africa, shipped there 60,783<!-- Page 13 --><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum">13</span>
Negro slaves, and after losing 14,387 on the middle passage,
delivered 46,396 in America. The trade increased early in the
eighteenth century, 104 ships clearing for Africa in 1701; it
then dwindled until the signing of the Assiento, standing at
74 clearances in 1724. The final dissolution of the monopoly
in 1750 led&mdash;excepting in the years 1754&ndash;57, when the closing
of Spanish marts sensibly affected the trade&mdash;to an extraordinary
development, 192 clearances being made in 1771. The
Revolutionary War nearly stopped the traffic; but by 1786 the
clearances had risen again to 146.</p>

<p>To these figures must be added the unregistered trade of
Americans and foreigners. It is probable that about 25,000
slaves were brought to America each year between 1698 and
1707. The importation then dwindled, but rose after the Assiento
to perhaps 30,000. The proportion, too, of these slaves
carried to the continent now began to increase. Of about
20,000 whom the English annually imported from 1733 to
1766, South Carolina alone received some 3,000. Before the
Revolution, the total exportation to America is variously estimated
as between 40,000 and 100,000 each year. Bancroft
places the total slave population of the continental colonies at
59,000 in 1714, 78,000 in 1727, and 293,000 in 1754. The census
of 1790 showed 697,897 slaves in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>In colonies like those in the West Indies and in South Carolina
and Georgia, the rapid importation into America of a
multitude of savages gave rise to a system of slavery far different
from that which the late Civil War abolished. The strikingly
harsh and even inhuman slave codes in these colonies
show this. Crucifixion, burning, and starvation were legal
modes of punishment.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The rough and brutal character of the
time and place was partly responsible for this, but a more
decisive reason lay in the fierce and turbulent character of
the imported Negroes. The docility to which long years of
bondage and strict discipline gave rise was absent, and in<!-- Page 14 --><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum">14</span>surrections
and acts of violence were of frequent occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Again and again the danger of planters being "cut off by their
own negroes"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> is mentioned, both in the islands and on the
continent. This condition of vague dread and unrest not only
increased the severity of laws and strengthened the police system,
but was the prime motive back of all the earlier efforts
to check the further importation of slaves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in New England and New York the
Negroes were merely house servants or farm hands, and were
treated neither better nor worse than servants in general in
those days. Between these two extremes, the system of slavery
varied from a mild serfdom in Pennsylvania and New Jersey
to an aristocratic caste system in Maryland and Virginia.</p>

</table>

<p>3. <b>Character of these Colonies.</b> The planting colonies are
those Southern settlements whose climate and character destined
them to be the chief theatre of North American slavery.
The early attitude of these communities toward the
slave-trade is therefore of peculiar interest; for their action
was of necessity largely decisive for the future of the trade
and for the institution in North America. Theirs was the
only soil, climate, and society suited to slavery; in the other
colonies, with few exceptions, the institution was by these
same factors doomed from the beginning. Hence, only
strong moral and political motives could in the planting colonies
overthrow or check a traffic so favored by the mother
country.</p>


<p>4. <b>Restrictions in Georgia.</b> In Georgia we have an example
of a community whose philanthropic founders sought to
impose upon it a code of morals higher than the colonists
wished. The settlers of Georgia were of even worse moral
fibre than their slave-trading and whiskey-using neighbors in
Carolina and Virginia; yet Oglethorpe and the London proprietors
prohibited from the beginning both the rum and the
slave traffic, refusing to "suffer slavery (which is against the
Gospel as well as the fundamental law of England) to be authorised
under our authority."<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">1</a> The trustees sought to win
the colonists over to their belief by telling them that money
could be better expended in transporting white men than
Negroes; that slaves would be a source of weakness to the
<!-- Page 16 --><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">16</span>colony; and that the "Produces designed to be raised in the
Colony would not require such Labour as to make Negroes
necessary for carrying them on."<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>This policy greatly displeased the colonists, who from 1735,
the date of the first law, to 1749, did not cease to clamor for
the repeal of the restrictions.<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor">3</a> As their English agent said,
they insisted that "In Spight of all Endeavours to disguise this
Point, it is as clear as Light itself, that Negroes are as essentially
necessary to the Cultivation of <i>Georgia</i>, as Axes, Hoes,
or any other Utensil of Agriculture."<a name="FNanchor_4_24" id="FNanchor_4_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_24" class="fnanchor">4</a> Meantime, evasions
and infractions of the laws became frequent and notorious.
Negroes were brought across from Carolina and "hired" for
life.<a name="FNanchor_5_25" id="FNanchor_5_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_25" class="fnanchor">5</a> "Finally, purchases were openly made in Savannah from
African traders: some seizures were made by those who opposed
the principle, but as a majority of the magistrates were
favorable to the introduction of slaves into the province, legal
decisions were suspended from time to time, and a strong
disposition evidenced by the courts to evade the operation of
the law."<a name="FNanchor_6_26" id="FNanchor_6_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_26" class="fnanchor">6</a> At last, in 1749, the colonists prevailed on the trustees
and the government, and the trade was thrown open under
careful restrictions, which limited importation, required a
registry and quarantine on all slaves brought in, and laid a
duty.<a name="FNanchor_7_27" id="FNanchor_7_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_27" class="fnanchor">7</a> It is probable, however, that these restrictions were
never enforced, and that the trade thus established continued
unchecked until the Revolution.</p>


<p>5. <b>Restrictions in South Carolina.</b><a name="FNanchor_8_28" id="FNanchor_8_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_28" class="fnanchor">8</a> South Carolina had
the largest and most widely developed slave-trade of any of
<!-- Page 17 --><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">17</span>the continental colonies. This was owing to the character of
her settlers, her nearness to the West Indian slave marts, and
the early development of certain staple crops, such as rice,
which were adapted to slave labor.<a name="FNanchor_9_29" id="FNanchor_9_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_29" class="fnanchor">9</a> Moreover, this colony
suffered much less interference from the home government
than many other colonies; thus it is possible here to trace the
untrammeled development of slave-trade restrictions in a typical
planting community.</p>

<p>As early as 1698 the slave-trade to South Carolina had
reached such proportions that it was thought that "the great
number of negroes which of late have been imported into this
Collony may endanger the safety thereof." The immigration
of white servants was therefore encouraged by a special law.<a name="FNanchor_10_30" id="FNanchor_10_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_30" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Increase of immigration reduced this disproportion, but Negroes
continued to be imported in such numbers as to afford
considerable revenue from a moderate duty on them. About
the time when the Assiento was signed, the slave-trade so increased
that, scarcely a year after the consummation of that
momentous agreement, two heavy duty acts were passed, because
"the number of Negroes do extremely increase in this
Province, and through the afflicting providence of God, the
white persons do not proportionately multiply, by reason whereof,
the safety of the said Province is greatly endangered."<a name="FNanchor_11_31" id="FNanchor_11_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_31" class="fnanchor">11</a><!-- Page 18 --><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum">18</span>
The trade, however, by reason of the encouragement abroad
and of increased business activity in exporting naval stores at
home, suffered scarcely any check, although repeated acts, reciting
the danger incident to a "great importation of Negroes,"
were passed, laying high duties.<a name="FNanchor_12_32" id="FNanchor_12_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_32" class="fnanchor">12</a> Finally, in 1717, an
additional duty of &pound;40,<a name="FNanchor_13_33" id="FNanchor_13_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_33" class="fnanchor">13</a> although due in depreciated currency,
succeeded so nearly in stopping the trade that, two
years later, all existing duties were repealed and one of &pound;10
substituted.<a name="FNanchor_14_34" id="FNanchor_14_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_34" class="fnanchor">14</a> This continued during the time of resistance to
the proprietary government, but by 1734 the importation had
again reached large proportions. "We must therefore beg
leave," the colonists write in that year, "to inform your Majesty,
that, amidst our other perilous circumstances, we are
subject to many intestine dangers from the great number of
negroes that are now among us, who amount at least to
twenty-two thousand persons, and are three to one of all your
Majesty's white subjects in this province. Insurrections
against us have been often attempted."<a name="FNanchor_15_35" id="FNanchor_15_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_35" class="fnanchor">15</a> In 1740 an insurrection
under a slave, Cato, at Stono, caused such widespread
alarm that a prohibitory duty of &pound;100 was immediately laid.<a name="FNanchor_16_36" id="FNanchor_16_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_36" class="fnanchor">16</a>
Importation was again checked; but in 1751 the colony sought
to devise a plan whereby the slightly restricted immigration
of Negroes should provide a fund to encourage the importation
of white servants, "to prevent the mischiefs that may be
attended by the great importation of negroes into this Province."<a name="FNanchor_17_37" id="FNanchor_17_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_37" class="fnanchor">17</a>
Many white servants were thus encouraged to settle in
the colony; but so much larger was the influx of black slaves
that the colony, in 1760, totally prohibited the slave-trade.
This act was promptly disallowed by the Privy Council and
<!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">19</span>the governor reprimanded;<a name="FNanchor_18_38" id="FNanchor_18_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_38" class="fnanchor">18</a> but the colony declared that "an
importation of negroes, equal in number to what have been
imported of late years, may prove of the most dangerous consequence
in many respects to this Province, and the best way
to obviate such danger will be by imposing such an additional
duty upon them as may totally prevent the evils."<a name="FNanchor_19_39" id="FNanchor_19_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_39" class="fnanchor">19</a> A prohibitive
duty of &pound;100 was accordingly imposed in 1764.<a name="FNanchor_20_40" id="FNanchor_20_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_40" class="fnanchor">20</a> This
duty probably continued until the Revolution.</p>

<p>The war made a great change in the situation. It has been
computed by good judges that, between the years 1775 and
1783, the State of South Carolina lost twenty-five thousand
Negroes, by actual hostilities, plunder of the British, runaways,
etc. After the war the trade quickly revived, and considerable
revenue was raised from duty acts until 1787, when by
act and ordinance the slave-trade was totally prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_21_41" id="FNanchor_21_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_41" class="fnanchor">21</a> This
prohibition, by renewals from time to time, lasted until 1803.</p>


<p>6. <b>Restrictions in North Carolina.</b> In early times there
were few slaves in North Carolina;<a name="FNanchor_22_42" id="FNanchor_22_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_42" class="fnanchor">22</a> this fact, together with
the troubled and turbulent state of affairs during the early
colonial period, did not necessitate the adoption of any settled
policy toward slavery or the slave-trade. Later the slave-trade
to the colony increased; but there is no evidence of any
effort to restrict or in any way regulate it before 1786, when
it was declared that "the importation of slaves into this State
is productive of evil consequences and highly impolitic,"<a name="FNanchor_23_43" id="FNanchor_23_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_43" class="fnanchor">23</a> and
a prohibitive duty was laid on them.</p>


<p>7. <b>Restrictions in Virginia.</b><a name="FNanchor_24_44" id="FNanchor_24_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_44" class="fnanchor">24</a> Next to South Carolina,
Virginia had probably the largest slave-trade. Her situation,
<!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">20</span>however, differed considerably from that of her Southern
neighbor. The climate, the staple tobacco crop, and the society
of Virginia were favorable to a system of domestic slavery,
but one which tended to develop into a patriarchal serfdom
rather than into a slave-consuming industrial hierarchy. The
labor required by the tobacco crop was less unhealthy than
that connected with the rice crop, and the Virginians were,
perhaps, on a somewhat higher moral plane than the Carolinians.
There was consequently no such insatiable demand for
slaves in the larger colony. On the other hand, the power of
the Virginia executive was peculiarly strong, and it was not
possible here to thwart the slave-trade policy of the home
government as easily as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Considering all these circumstances, it is somewhat difficult
to determine just what was the attitude of the early Virginians
toward the slave-trade. There is evidence, however, to show
that although they desired the slave-trade, the rate at which
the Negroes were brought in soon alarmed them. In 1710 a
duty of &pound;5 was laid on Negroes, but Governor Spotswood
"soon perceived that the laying so high a Duty on Negros was
intended to discourage the importation," and vetoed the measure.<a name="FNanchor_25_45" id="FNanchor_25_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_45" class="fnanchor">25</a>
No further restrictive legislation was attempted for
some years, but whether on account of the attitude of the
governor or the desire of the inhabitants, is not clear. With<!-- Page 21 --><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">21</span>
1723 begins a series of acts extending down to the Revolution,
which, so far as their contents can be ascertained, seem to
have been designed effectually to check the slave-trade. Some
of these acts, like those of 1723 and 1727, were almost immediately
disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_26_46" id="FNanchor_26_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_46" class="fnanchor">26</a> The Act of 1732 laid a duty of 5%, which
was continued until 1769,<a name="FNanchor_27_47" id="FNanchor_27_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_47" class="fnanchor">27</a> and all other duties were in addition
to this; so that by such cumulative duties the rate on
slaves reached 25% in 1755,<a name="FNanchor_28_48" id="FNanchor_28_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_48" class="fnanchor">28</a> and 35% at the time of Braddock's
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_29_49" id="FNanchor_29_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_49" class="fnanchor">29</a> These acts were found "very burthensome," "introductive
of many frauds," and "very inconvenient,"<a name="FNanchor_30_50" id="FNanchor_30_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_50" class="fnanchor">30</a> and
were so far repealed that by 1761 the duty was only 15%. As
now the Burgesses became more powerful, two or more bills
proposing restrictive duties were passed, but disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_31_51" id="FNanchor_31_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_51" class="fnanchor">31</a> By
1772 the anti-slave-trade feeling had become considerably developed,
and the Burgesses petitioned the king, declaring that
"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of
Africa hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity,
and under its present encouragement, we have too much
reason to fear <i>will endanger the very existence</i> of your Majesty's
American dominions.... Deeply impressed with these sentiments,
we most humbly beseech your Majesty to remove <i>all
those restraints</i> on your Majesty's governors of this colony,
<i>which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce</i>."<a name="FNanchor_32_52" id="FNanchor_32_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_52" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Nothing further appears to have been done before the war.
When, in 1776, the delegates adopted a Frame of Government,
it was charged in this document that the king had perverted
his high office into a "detestable and insupportable
tyranny, by ... prompting our negroes to rise in arms
among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of
his negative, he hath refused us permission to exclude by
law."<a name="FNanchor_33_53" id="FNanchor_33_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_53" class="fnanchor">33</a> Two years later, in 1778, an "Act to prevent the further
<!-- Page 22 --><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">22</span>importation of Slaves" stopped definitively the legal slave-trade
to Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_34_54" id="FNanchor_34_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_54" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>


<p>8. <b>Restrictions in Maryland.</b><a name="FNanchor_35_55" id="FNanchor_35_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_55" class="fnanchor">35</a> Not until the impulse of the
Assiento had been felt in America, did Maryland make any
attempt to restrain a trade from which she had long enjoyed
a comfortable revenue. The Act of 1717, laying a duty of 40<i>s.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_56" id="FNanchor_36_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_56" class="fnanchor">36</a>
may have been a mild restrictive measure. The duties were
slowly increased to 50<i>s.</i> in 1754,<a name="FNanchor_37_57" id="FNanchor_37_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_57" class="fnanchor">37</a> and &pound;4. in 1763.<a name="FNanchor_38_58" id="FNanchor_38_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_58" class="fnanchor">38</a> In 1771 a
prohibitive duty of &pound;9 was laid;<a name="FNanchor_39_59" id="FNanchor_39_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_59" class="fnanchor">39</a> and in 1783, after the war,
all importation by sea was stopped and illegally imported Negroes
were freed.<a name="FNanchor_40_60" id="FNanchor_40_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_60" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Compared with the trade to Virginia and the Carolinas,
the slave-trade to Maryland was small, and seems at no time
to have reached proportions which alarmed the inhabitants.
It was regulated to the economic demand by a slowly increasing
tariff, and finally, after 1769, had nearly ceased of
its own accord before the restrictive legislation of Revolutionary
times.<a name="FNanchor_41_61" id="FNanchor_41_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_61" class="fnanchor">41</a> Probably the proximity of Maryland to Vir<!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">23</span>ginia
made an independent slave-trade less necessary to her.</p>


<p>9. <b>General Character of these Restrictions.</b> We find in
the planting colonies all degrees of advocacy of the trade,
from the passiveness of Maryland to the clamor of Georgia.
Opposition to the trade did not appear in Georgia, was based
almost solely on political fear of insurrection in Carolina, and
sprang largely from the same motive in Virginia, mingled
with some moral repugnance. As a whole, it may be said that
whatever opposition to the slave-trade there was in the planting
colonies was based principally on the political fear of
insurrection.</p>

<p>10. <b>Character of these Colonies.</b> The colonies of this group,
occupying the central portion of the English possessions,
comprise those communities where, on account of climate,
physical characteristics, and circumstances of settlement, slavery
as an institution found but a narrow field for development.
The climate was generally rather cool for the newly
imported slaves, the soil was best suited to crops to which
slave labor was poorly adapted, and the training and habits of
the great body of settlers offered little chance for the growth
of a slave system. These conditions varied, of course, in different
colonies; but the general statement applies to all. These
communities of small farmers and traders derived whatever
opposition they had to the slave-trade from three sorts of
motives,&mdash;economic, political, and moral. First, the importation
of slaves did not pay, except to supply a moderate demand
for household servants. Secondly, these colonies, as well as
those in the South, had a wholesome political fear of a large
servile population. Thirdly, the settlers of many of these colonies
were of sterner moral fibre than the Southern cavaliers
and adventurers, and, in the absence of great counteracting
motives, were more easily led to oppose the institution and
the trade. Finally, it must be noted that these colonies did not
so generally regard themselves as temporary commercial investments
as did Virginia and Carolina. Intending to found
permanent States, these settlers from the first more carefully
studied the ultimate interests of those States.</p>


<p>11. <b>The Dutch Slave-Trade.</b> The Dutch seem to have commenced
the slave-trade to the American continent, the Middle
colonies and some of the Southern receiving supplies from
<!-- Page 25 --><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">25</span>them. John Rolfe relates that the last of August, 1619, there
came to Virginia "a dutch man of warre that sold us twenty
Negars."<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">1</a> This was probably one of the ships of the numerous
private Dutch trading-companies which early entered into
and developed the lucrative African slave-trade. Ships sailed
from Holland to Africa, got slaves in exchange for their
goods, carried the slaves to the West Indies or Brazil, and
returned home laden with sugar.<a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_63" class="fnanchor">2</a> Through the enterprise of
one of these trading-companies the settlement of New Amsterdam
was begun, in 1614. In 1621 the private companies
trading in the West were all merged into the Dutch West India
Company, and given a monopoly of American trade. This
company was very active, sending in four years 15,430 Negroes
to Brazil,<a name="FNanchor_3_64" id="FNanchor_3_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_64" class="fnanchor">3</a> carrying on war with Spain, supplying even
the English plantations,<a name="FNanchor_4_65" id="FNanchor_4_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_65" class="fnanchor">4</a> and gradually becoming the great
slave carrier of the day.</p>

<p>The commercial supremacy of the Dutch early excited the
envy and emulation of the English. The Navigation Ordinance
of 1651 was aimed at them, and two wars were necessary
to wrest the slave-trade from them and place it in the hands
of the English. The final terms of peace among other things
surrendered New Netherland to England, and opened the
way for England to become henceforth the world's greatest
slave-trader. Although the Dutch had thus commenced the
continental slave-trade, they had not actually furnished a very
large number of slaves to the English colonies outside the
West Indies. A small trade had, by 1698, brought a few thousand
to New York, and still fewer to New Jersey.<a name="FNanchor_5_66" id="FNanchor_5_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_66" class="fnanchor">5</a> It was left
to the English, with their strong policy in its favor, to develop
this trade.</p>


<p>12. <b>Restrictions in New York.</b><a name="FNanchor_6_67" id="FNanchor_6_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_67" class="fnanchor">6</a> The early ordinances of
<!-- Page 26 --><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">26</span>the Dutch, laying duties, generally of ten per cent, on slaves,
probably proved burdensome to the trade, although this was
not intentional.<a name="FNanchor_7_68" id="FNanchor_7_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_68" class="fnanchor">7</a> The Biblical prohibition of slavery and the
slave-trade, copied from New England codes into the Duke
of York's Laws, had no practical application,<a name="FNanchor_8_69" id="FNanchor_8_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_69" class="fnanchor">8</a> and the trade
continued to be encouraged in the governors' instructions. In
1709 a duty of &pound;3 was laid on Negroes from elsewhere than
Africa.<a name="FNanchor_9_70" id="FNanchor_9_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_70" class="fnanchor">9</a> This was aimed at West India slaves, and was prohibitive.
By 1716 the duty on all slaves was &pound;1 12&frac12;<i>s.</i>, which was
probably a mere revenue figure.<a name="FNanchor_10_71" id="FNanchor_10_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_71" class="fnanchor">10</a> In 1728 a duty of 40<i>s.</i> was
laid, to be continued until 1737.<a name="FNanchor_11_72" id="FNanchor_11_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_72" class="fnanchor">11</a> It proved restrictive, however,
and on the "humble petition of the Merchants and<!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum">27</span>
Traders of the City of Bristol" was disallowed in 1735, as
"greatly prejudicial to the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_12_73" id="FNanchor_12_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_73" class="fnanchor">12</a>
Governor Cosby was also reminded that no duties on
slaves payable by the importer were to be laid. Later, in 1753,
the 40<i>s.</i> duty was restored, but under the increased trade of
those days was not felt.<a name="FNanchor_13_74" id="FNanchor_13_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_74" class="fnanchor">13</a> No further restrictions seem to have
been attempted until 1785, when the sale of slaves in the State
was forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_14_75" id="FNanchor_14_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_75" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The chief element of restriction in this colony appears to
have been the shrewd business sense of the traders, who
never flooded the slave market, but kept a supply sufficient
for the slowly growing demand. Between 1701 and 1726 only
about 2,375 slaves were imported, and in 1774 the total slave
population amounted to 21,149.<a name="FNanchor_15_76" id="FNanchor_15_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_76" class="fnanchor">15</a> No restriction was ever
put by New York on participation in the trade outside the
colony, and in spite of national laws New York merchants
continued to be engaged in this traffic even down to the
Civil War.<a name="FNanchor_16_77" id="FNanchor_16_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_77" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Vermont, who withdrew from New York in 1777, in her
<!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum">28</span>first Constitution<a name="FNanchor_17_78" id="FNanchor_17_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_78" class="fnanchor">17</a> declared slavery illegal, and in 1786 stopped
by law the sale and transportation of slaves within her boundaries.<a name="FNanchor_18_79" id="FNanchor_18_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_79" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>


<p>13. <b>Restrictions in Pennsylvania and Delaware.</b><a name="FNanchor_19_80" id="FNanchor_19_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_80" class="fnanchor">19</a> One of
the first American protests against the slave-trade came from
certain German Friends, in 1688, at a Weekly Meeting held in
Germantown, Pennsylvania. "These are the reasons," wrote
"Garret henderich, derick up de graeff, Francis daniell Pastorius,
and Abraham up Den graef," "why we are against the
traffick of men-body, as followeth: Is there any that would be
done or handled at this manner?... Now, tho they are
black, we cannot conceive there is more liberty to have them
slaves, as it is to have other white ones. There is a saying, that
we shall doe to all men like as we will be done ourselves;
making no difference of what generation, descent or colour
they are. And those who steal or robb men, and those who
<!-- Page 29 --><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">29</span>buy or purchase them, are they not all alike?"<a name="FNanchor_20_81" id="FNanchor_20_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_81" class="fnanchor">20</a> This little
leaven helped slowly to work a revolution in the attitude of
this great sect toward slavery and the slave-trade. The Yearly
Meeting at first postponed the matter, "It having so General
a Relation to many other Parts."<a name="FNanchor_21_82" id="FNanchor_21_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_82" class="fnanchor">21</a> Eventually, however, in
1696, the Yearly Meeting advised "That Friends be careful not
to encourage the bringing in of any more Negroes."<a name="FNanchor_22_83" id="FNanchor_22_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_83" class="fnanchor">22</a> This
advice was repeated in stronger terms for a quarter-century,<a name="FNanchor_23_84" id="FNanchor_23_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_84" class="fnanchor">23</a>
and by that time Sandiford, Benezet, Lay, and Woolman had
begun their crusade. In 1754 the Friends took a step farther
and made the purchase of slaves a matter of discipline.<a name="FNanchor_24_85" id="FNanchor_24_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_85" class="fnanchor">24</a> Four
years later the Yearly Meeting expressed itself clearly as
"against every branch of this practice," and declared that if
"any professing with us should persist to vindicate it, and be
concerned in importing, selling or purchasing slaves, the respective
Monthly Meetings to which they belong should
manifest their disunion with such persons."<a name="FNanchor_25_86" id="FNanchor_25_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_86" class="fnanchor">25</a> Further, manumission
was recommended, and in 1776 made compulsory.<a name="FNanchor_26_87" id="FNanchor_26_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_87" class="fnanchor">26</a>
The effect of this attitude of the Friends was early manifested
in the legislation of all the colonies where the sect was influential,
and particularly in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>One of the first duty acts (1710) laid a restrictive duty of
40<i>s.</i> on slaves, and was eventually disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_27_88" id="FNanchor_27_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_88" class="fnanchor">27</a> In 1712 William
Southeby petitioned the Assembly totally to abolish slavery.
This the Assembly naturally refused to attempt; but the
same year, in response to another petition "signed by many
hands," they passed an "Act to prevent the Importation of
Negroes and Indians,"<a name="FNanchor_28_89" id="FNanchor_28_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_89" class="fnanchor">28</a>&mdash;the first enactment of its kind in<!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">30</span>
America. This act was inspired largely by the general fear of
insurrection which succeeded the "Negro-plot" of 1712 in
New York. It declared: "Whereas, divers Plots and Insurrections
have frequently happened, not only in the Islands but
on the Main Land of <i>America</i>, by Negroes, which have been
carried on so far that several of the inhabitants have been barbarously
Murthered, an Instance whereof we have lately had
in our Neighboring Colony of <i>New York</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_29_90" id="FNanchor_29_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_90" class="fnanchor">29</a> etc. It then proceeded
to lay a prohibitive duty of &pound;20 on all slaves imported.
These acts were quickly disposed of in England. Three duty
acts affecting Negroes, including the prohibitory act, were in
1713 disallowed, and it was directed that "the Dep<sup>ty</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
Council and Assembly of Pensilvania, be &amp; they are hereby
Strictly Enjoyned &amp; required not to permit the said Laws
... to be from henceforward put in Execution."<a name="FNanchor_30_91" id="FNanchor_30_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_91" class="fnanchor">30</a> The Assembly
repealed these laws, but in 1715 passed another laying
a duty of &pound;5, which was also eventually disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_31_92" id="FNanchor_31_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_92" class="fnanchor">31</a> Other
acts, the provisions of which are not clear, were passed in 1720
and 1722,<a name="FNanchor_32_93" id="FNanchor_32_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_93" class="fnanchor">32</a> and in 1725&ndash;1726 the duty on Negroes was raised
to the restrictive figure of &pound;10.<a name="FNanchor_33_94" id="FNanchor_33_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_94" class="fnanchor">33</a> This duty, for some reason
not apparent, was lowered to &pound;2 in 1729,<a name="FNanchor_34_95" id="FNanchor_34_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_95" class="fnanchor">34</a> but restored again
in 1761.<a name="FNanchor_35_96" id="FNanchor_35_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_96" class="fnanchor">35</a> A struggle occurred over this last measure, the
Friends petitioning for it, and the Philadelphia merchants
against it, declaring that "We, the subscribers, ever desirous
<!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum">31</span>to extend the Trade of this Province, have seen, for some time
past, the many inconveniencys the Inhabitants have suffer'd
for want of Labourers and artificers, ... have for some time
encouraged the importation of Negroes;" they prayed therefore
at least for a delay in passing the measure.<a name="FNanchor_36_97" id="FNanchor_36_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_97" class="fnanchor">36</a> The law,
nevertheless, after much debate and altercation with the governor,
finally passed.</p>

<p>These repeated acts nearly stopped the trade, and the manumission
or sale of Negroes by the Friends decreased the
number of slaves in the province. The rising spirit of independence
enabled the colony, in 1773, to restore the prohibitive
duty of &pound;20 and make it perpetual.<a name="FNanchor_37_98" id="FNanchor_37_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_98" class="fnanchor">37</a> After the Revolution unpaid
duties on slaves were collected and the slaves registered,<a name="FNanchor_38_99" id="FNanchor_38_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_99" class="fnanchor">38</a>
and in 1780 an "Act for the gradual Abolition of Slavery" was
passed.<a name="FNanchor_39_100" id="FNanchor_39_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_100" class="fnanchor">39</a> As there were probably at no time before the war
more than 11,000 slaves in Pennsylvania,<a name="FNanchor_40_101" id="FNanchor_40_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_101" class="fnanchor">40</a> the task thus accomplished
was not so formidable as in many other States. As it
was, participation in the slave-trade outside the colony was
not prohibited until 1788.<a name="FNanchor_41_102" id="FNanchor_41_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_102" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>It seems probable that in the original Swedish settlements
along the Delaware slavery was prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_42_103" id="FNanchor_42_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_103" class="fnanchor">42</a> This measure
had, however, little practical effect; for as soon as the Dutch
got control the slave-trade was opened, although, as it appears,
to no large extent. After the fall of the Dutch Delaware
came into English hands. Not until 1775 do we find any legislation
on the slave-trade. In that year the colony attempted
<!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">32</span>to prohibit the importation of slaves, but the governor vetoed
the bill.<a name="FNanchor_43_104" id="FNanchor_43_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_104" class="fnanchor">43</a> Finally, in 1776 by the Constitution, and in 1787 by
law, importation and exportation were both prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_44_105" id="FNanchor_44_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_105" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<p>14. <b>Restrictions in New Jersey.</b><a name="FNanchor_45_106" id="FNanchor_45_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_106" class="fnanchor">45</a> Although the freeholders
of West New Jersey declared, in 1676, that "all and every Person
and Persons Inhabiting the said Province, shall, as far as
in us lies, be free from Oppression and Slavery,"<a name="FNanchor_46_107" id="FNanchor_46_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_107" class="fnanchor">46</a> yet Negro
slaves are early found in the colony.<a name="FNanchor_47_108" id="FNanchor_47_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_108" class="fnanchor">47</a> The first restrictive measure
was passed, after considerable friction between the
Council and the House, in 1713; it laid a duty of &pound;10, currency.<a name="FNanchor_48_109" id="FNanchor_48_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_109" class="fnanchor">48</a>
Governor Hunter explained to the Board of Trade
that the bill was "calculated to Encourage the Importation of
white Servants for the better Peopeling that Country."<a name="FNanchor_49_110" id="FNanchor_49_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_110" class="fnanchor">49</a> How
long this act continued does not appear; probably, not long.
No further legislation was enacted until 1762 or 1763, when a
prohibitive duty was laid on account of "the inconvenience
the Province is exposed to in lying open to the free importation
of Negros, when the Provinces on each side have laid
duties on them."<a name="FNanchor_50_111" id="FNanchor_50_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_111" class="fnanchor">50</a> The Board of Trade declared that while
they did not object to "the Policy of imposing a reasonable
duty," they could not assent to this, and the act was disallowed.<a name="FNanchor_51_112" id="FNanchor_51_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_112" class="fnanchor">51</a>
The Act of 1769 evaded the technical objection of the
Board of Trade, and laid a duty of &pound;15 on the first purchasers
of Negroes, because, as the act declared, "Duties on the Im<!-- Page 33 --><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">33</span>portation
of Negroes in several of the neighbouring Colonies
hath, on Experience, been found beneficial in the Introduction
of sober, industrious Foreigners."<a name="FNanchor_52_113" id="FNanchor_52_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_113" class="fnanchor">52</a> In 1774 a bill which,
according to the report of the Council to Governor Morris,
"plainly intended an entire Prohibition of all Slaves being imported
from foreign Parts," was thrown out by the Council.<a name="FNanchor_53_114" id="FNanchor_53_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_114" class="fnanchor">53</a>
Importation was finally prohibited in 1786.<a name="FNanchor_54_115" id="FNanchor_54_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_115" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>


<p>15. <b>General Character of these Restrictions.</b> The main
difference in motive between the restrictions which the planting
and the farming colonies put on the African slave-trade,
lay in the fact that the former limited it mainly from fear of
insurrection, the latter mainly because it did not pay. Naturally,
the latter motive worked itself out with much less legislation
than the former; for this reason, and because they
held a smaller number of slaves, most of these colonies have
fewer actual statutes than the Southern colonies. In Pennsylvania
alone did this general economic revolt against the trade
acquire a distinct moral tinge. Although even here the institution
was naturally doomed, yet the clear moral insight of
the Quakers checked the trade much earlier than would otherwise
have happened. We may say, then, that the farming
colonies checked the slave-trade primarily from economic
motives.</p>

<p>16. <b>Character of these Colonies.</b> The rigorous climate of
New England, the character of her settlers, and their pronounced
political views gave slavery an even slighter basis
here than in the Middle colonies. The significance of New
England in the African slave-trade does not therefore lie in
the fact that she early discountenanced the system of slavery
and stopped importation; but rather in the fact that her citizens,
being the traders of the New World, early took part in
the carrying slave-trade and furnished slaves to the other colonies.
An inquiry, therefore, into the efforts of the New England
colonies to suppress the slave-trade would fall naturally
into two parts: first, and chiefly, an investigation of the efforts
to stop the participation of citizens in the carrying slave-trade;
secondly, an examination of the efforts made to banish the
slave-trade from New England soil.</p>


<p>17. <b>New England and the Slave-Trade.</b> Vessels from Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_1_116" id="FNanchor_1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_116" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Rhode Island,<a name="FNanchor_2_117" id="FNanchor_2_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_117" class="fnanchor">2</a> Connecticut,<a name="FNanchor_3_118" id="FNanchor_3_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_118" class="fnanchor">3</a> and, to a less extent,
from New Hampshire,<a name="FNanchor_4_119" id="FNanchor_4_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_119" class="fnanchor">4</a> were early and largely engaged
in the carrying slave-trade. "We know," said Thomas Pemberton
in 1795, "that a large trade to Guinea was carried on for
many years by the citizens of Massachusetts Colony, who
were the proprietors of the vessels and their cargoes, out and
<!-- Page 35 --><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum">35</span>home. Some of the slaves purchased in Guinea, and I suppose
the greatest part of them, were sold in the West Indies."<a name="FNanchor_5_120" id="FNanchor_5_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_120" class="fnanchor">5</a> Dr.
John Eliot asserted that "it made a considerable branch of our
commerce.... It declined very little till the Revolution."<a name="FNanchor_6_121" id="FNanchor_6_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_121" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Yet the trade of this colony was said not to equal that of
Rhode Island. Newport was the mart for slaves offered for
sale in the North, and a point of reshipment for all slaves. It
was principally this trade that raised Newport to her commercial
importance in the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_7_122" id="FNanchor_7_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_122" class="fnanchor">7</a> Connecticut, too,
was an important slave-trader, sending large numbers of
horses and other commodities to the West Indies in exchange
for slaves, and selling the slaves in other colonies.</p>

<p>This trade formed a perfect circle. Owners of slavers carried
slaves to South Carolina, and brought home naval stores for
their ship-building; or to the West Indies, and brought home
molasses; or to other colonies, and brought home hogsheads.
The molasses was made into the highly prized New England
rum, and shipped in these hogsheads to Africa for more
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_8_123" id="FNanchor_8_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_123" class="fnanchor">8</a> Thus, the rum-distilling industry indicates to some
extent the activity of New England in the slave-trade. In May,
1752, one Captain Freeman found so many slavers fitting out
that, in spite of the large importations of molasses, he could
get no rum for his vessel.<a name="FNanchor_9_124" id="FNanchor_9_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_124" class="fnanchor">9</a> In Newport alone twenty-two stills
<!-- Page 36 --><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">36</span>were at one time running continuously;<a name="FNanchor_10_125" id="FNanchor_10_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_125" class="fnanchor">10</a> and Massachusetts
annually distilled 15,000 hogsheads of molasses into this "chief
manufacture."<a name="FNanchor_11_126" id="FNanchor_11_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_126" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Turning now to restrictive measures, we must first note the
measures of the slave-consuming colonies which tended to
limit the trade. These measures, however, came comparatively
late, were enforced with varying degrees of efficiency, and did
not seriously affect the slave-trade before the Revolution. The
moral sentiment of New England put some check upon the
trade. Although in earlier times the most respectable people
took ventures in slave-trading voyages, yet there gradually
arose a moral sentiment which tended to make the business
somewhat disreputable.<a name="FNanchor_12_127" id="FNanchor_12_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_127" class="fnanchor">12</a> In the line, however, of definite legal
enactments to stop New England citizens from carrying slaves
from Africa to any place in the world, there were, before the
Revolution, none. Indeed, not until the years 1787&ndash;1788 was
slave-trading in itself an indictable offence in any New England
State.</p>

<p>The particular situation in each colony, and the efforts to
restrict the small importing slave-trade of New England, can
best be studied in a separate view of each community.</p>


<p>18. <b>Restrictions in New Hampshire.</b> The statistics of slavery
in New Hampshire show how weak an institution it always was
in that colony.<a name="FNanchor_13_128" id="FNanchor_13_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_128" class="fnanchor">13</a> Consequently, when the usual instructions
were sent to Governor Wentworth as to the encouragement he
must give to the slave-trade, the House replied: "We have considered
his Maj<sup>ties</sup> Instruction relating to an Impost on Negroes
&amp; Felons, to which this House answers, that there never was
any duties laid on either, by this Goverm<sup>t</sup>, and so few bro't in
<!-- Page 37 --><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">37</span>that it would not be worth the Publick notice, so as to make an
act concerning them."<a name="FNanchor_14_129" id="FNanchor_14_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_129" class="fnanchor">14</a> This remained true for the whole
history of the colony. Importation was never stopped by actual
enactment, but was eventually declared contrary to the Constitution
of 1784.<a name="FNanchor_15_130" id="FNanchor_15_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_130" class="fnanchor">15</a> The participation of citizens in the trade
appears never to have been forbidden.</p>


<p>19. <b>Restrictions in Massachusetts.</b> The early Biblical codes
of Massachusetts confined slavery to "lawfull Captives taken
in iust warres, &amp; such strangers as willingly selle themselves
or are sold to us."<a name="FNanchor_16_131" id="FNanchor_16_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_131" class="fnanchor">16</a> The stern Puritanism of early days endeavored
to carry this out literally, and consequently when a
certain Captain Smith, about 1640, attacked an African village
and brought some of the unoffending natives home, he was
promptly arrested. Eventually, the General Court ordered the
Negroes sent home at the colony's expense, "conceiving
themselues bound by y<sup>e</sup> first oportunity to bear witnes against
y<sup>e</sup> haynos &amp; crying sinn of manstealing, as also to P'scribe
such timely redresse for what is past, &amp; such a law for y<sup>e</sup>
future as may sufficiently deterr all oth<sup>r</sup>s belonging to us to
have to do in such vile &amp; most odious courses, iustly abhored
of all good &amp; iust men."<a name="FNanchor_17_132" id="FNanchor_17_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_132" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The temptation of trade slowly forced the colony from this
high moral ground. New England ships were early found in
the West Indian slave-trade, and the more the carrying trade
developed, the more did the profits of this branch of it attract
Puritan captains. By the beginning of the eighteenth century
the slave-trade was openly recognized as legitimate commerce;
cargoes came regularly to Boston, and "The merchants
of Boston quoted negroes, like any other merchandise demanded
by their correspondents."<a name="FNanchor_18_133" id="FNanchor_18_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_133" class="fnanchor">18</a> At the same time, the Puritan
conscience began to rebel against the growth of actual
slavery on New England soil. It was a much less violent
wrenching of moral ideas of right and wrong to allow Mas<!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum">38</span>sachusetts
men to carry slaves to South Carolina than to allow
cargoes to come into Boston, and become slaves in Massachusetts.
Early in the eighteenth century, therefore, opposition
arose to the further importation of Negroes, and in 1705 an
act "for the Better Preventing of a Spurious and Mixt Issue,"
laid a restrictive duty of &pound;4 on all slaves imported.<a name="FNanchor_19_134" id="FNanchor_19_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_134" class="fnanchor">19</a> One provision
of this act plainly illustrates the attitude of Massachusetts:
like the acts of many of the New England colonies, it
allowed a rebate of the whole duty on re-exportation. The
harbors of New England were thus offered as a free exchange-mart
for slavers. All the duty acts of the Southern and Middle
colonies allowed a rebate of one-half or three-fourths of the
duty on the re-exportation of the slave, thus laying a small tax
on even temporary importation.</p>

<p>The Act of 1705 was evaded, but it was not amended until
1728, when the penalty for evasion was raised to &pound;100.<a name="FNanchor_20_135" id="FNanchor_20_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_135" class="fnanchor">20</a> The
act remained in force, except possibly for one period of four
years, until 1749. Meantime the movement against importation
grew. A bill "for preventing the Importation of Slaves
into this Province" was introduced in the Legislature in 1767,
but after strong opposition and disagreement between House
and Council it was dropped.<a name="FNanchor_21_136" id="FNanchor_21_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_136" class="fnanchor">21</a> In 1771 the struggle was renewed.
A similar bill passed, but was vetoed by Governor
Hutchinson.<a name="FNanchor_22_137" id="FNanchor_22_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_137" class="fnanchor">22</a> The imminent war and the discussions incident
to it had now more and more aroused public opinion, and
there were repeated attempts to gain executive consent to a
prohibitory law. In 1774 such a bill was twice passed, but
never received assent.<a name="FNanchor_23_138" id="FNanchor_23_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_138" class="fnanchor">23</a></p><p><!-- Page 39 --><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">39</span></p>

<p>The new Revolutionary government first met the subject in
the case of two Negroes captured on the high seas, who were
advertised for sale at Salem. A resolution was introduced into
the Legislature, directing the release of the Negroes, and declaring
"That the selling and enslaving the human species is a
direct violation of the natural rights alike vested in all men by
their Creator, and utterly inconsistent with the avowed principles
on which this, and the other United States, have carried
their struggle for liberty even to the last appeal." To this the
Council would not consent; and the resolution, as finally
passed, merely forbade the sale or ill-treatment of the Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_24_139" id="FNanchor_24_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_139" class="fnanchor">24</a>
Committees on the slavery question were appointed
in 1776 and 1777,<a name="FNanchor_25_140" id="FNanchor_25_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_140" class="fnanchor">25</a> and although a letter to Congress on the
matter, and a bill for the abolition of slavery were reported,
no decisive action was taken.</p>

<p>All such efforts were finally discontinued, as the system was
already practically extinct in Massachusetts and the custom of
importation had nearly ceased. Slavery was eventually declared
by judicial decision to have been abolished.<a name="FNanchor_26_141" id="FNanchor_26_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_141" class="fnanchor">26</a> The first
step toward stopping the participation of Massachusetts citizens
in the slave-trade outside the State was taken in 1785,
when a committee of inquiry was appointed by the Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_27_142" id="FNanchor_27_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_142" class="fnanchor">27</a>
No act was, however, passed until 1788, when participation
in the trade was prohibited, on pain of &pound;50 forfeit for
every slave and &pound;200 for every ship engaged.<a name="FNanchor_28_143" id="FNanchor_28_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_143" class="fnanchor">28</a></p><p><!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">40</span></p>


<p>20. <b>Restrictions in Rhode Island.</b> In 1652 Rhode Island
passed a law designed to prohibit life slavery in the colony. It
declared that "Whereas, there is a common course practised
amongst English men to buy negers, to that end they may
have them for service or slaves forever; for the preventinge of
such practices among us, let it be ordered, that no blacke
mankind or white being forced by covenant bond, or otherwise,
to serve any man or his assighnes longer than ten yeares,
or untill they come to bee twentie four yeares of age, if they
bee taken in under fourteen, from the time of their cominge
within the liberties of this Collonie. And at the end or terme
of ten yeares to sett them free, as the manner is with the
English servants. And that man that will not let them goe
free, or shall sell them away elsewhere, to that end that they
may bee enslaved to others for a long time, hee or they shall
forfeit to the Collonie forty pounds."<a name="FNanchor_29_144" id="FNanchor_29_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_144" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>This law was for a time enforced,<a name="FNanchor_30_145" id="FNanchor_30_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_145" class="fnanchor">30</a> but by the beginning of
the eighteenth century it had either been repealed or become
a dead letter; for the Act of 1708 recognized perpetual slavery,
and laid an impost of &pound;3 on Negroes imported.<a name="FNanchor_31_146" id="FNanchor_31_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_146" class="fnanchor">31</a> This duty
was really a tax on the transport trade, and produced a steady
<!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">41</span>income for twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_32_147" id="FNanchor_32_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_147" class="fnanchor">32</a> From the year 1700 on, the citizens
of this State engaged more and more in the carrying trade,
until Rhode Island became the greatest slave-trader in America.
Although she did not import many slaves for her own
use, she became the clearing-house for the trade of other colonies.
Governor Cranston, as early as 1708, reported that between
1698 and 1708 one hundred and three vessels were built
in the State, all of which were trading to the West Indies and
the Southern colonies.<a name="FNanchor_33_148" id="FNanchor_33_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_148" class="fnanchor">33</a> They took out lumber and brought
back molasses, in most cases making a slave voyage in between.
From this, the trade grew. Samuel Hopkins, about
1770, was shocked at the state of the trade: more than thirty
distilleries were running in the colony, and one hundred and
fifty vessels were in the slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_34_149" id="FNanchor_34_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_149" class="fnanchor">34</a> "Rhode Island," said he,
"has been more deeply interested in the slave-trade, and has
enslaved more Africans than any other colony in New England."
Later, in 1787, he wrote: "The inhabitants of Rhode
Island, especially those of Newport, have had by far the
greater share in this traffic, of all these United States. This
trade in human species has been the first wheel of commerce
in Newport, on which every other movement in business has
chiefly depended. That town has been built up, and flourished
in times past, at the expense of the blood, the liberty, and
happiness of the poor Africans; and the inhabitants have lived
on this, and by it have gotten most of their wealth and
riches."<a name="FNanchor_35_150" id="FNanchor_35_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_150" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The Act of 1708 was poorly enforced. The "good intentions"
of its framers "were wholly frustrated" by the clandestine
"hiding and conveying said negroes out of the town
[Newport] into the country, where they lie concealed."<a name="FNanchor_36_151" id="FNanchor_36_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_151" class="fnanchor">36</a> The
act was accordingly strengthened by the Acts of 1712 and 1715,
and made to apply to importations by land as well as by sea.<a name="FNanchor_37_152" id="FNanchor_37_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_152" class="fnanchor">37</a>
The Act of 1715, however, favored the trade by admitting<!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum">42</span>
African Negroes free of duty. The chaotic state of Rhode Island
did not allow England often to review her legislation;
but as soon as the Act of 1712 came to notice it was disallowed,
and accordingly repealed in 1732.<a name="FNanchor_38_153" id="FNanchor_38_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_153" class="fnanchor">38</a> Whether the Act of
1715 remained, or whether any other duty act was passed, is
not clear.</p>

<p>While the foreign trade was flourishing, the influence of
the Friends and of other causes eventually led to a movement
against slavery as a local institution. Abolition societies
multiplied, and in 1770 an abolition bill was ordered by the
Assembly, but it was never passed.<a name="FNanchor_39_154" id="FNanchor_39_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_154" class="fnanchor">39</a> Four years later the city
of Providence resolved that "as personal liberty is an essential
part of the natural rights of mankind," the importation
of slaves and the system of slavery should cease in the colony.<a name="FNanchor_40_155" id="FNanchor_40_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_155" class="fnanchor">40</a>
This movement finally resulted, in 1774, in an act "prohibiting
the importation of Negroes into this Colony,"&mdash;a
law which curiously illustrated the attitude of Rhode Island
toward the slave-trade. The preamble of the act declared:
"Whereas, the inhabitants of America are generally engaged
in the preservation of their own rights and liberties, among
which, that of personal freedom must be considered as the
greatest; as those who are desirous of enjoying all the advantages
of liberty themselves, should be willing to extend personal
liberty to others;&mdash;Therefore," etc. The statute then
proceeded to enact "that for the future, no negro or mulatto
slave shall be brought into this colony; and in case any slave
shall hereafter be brought in, he or she shall be, and are
hereby, rendered immediately free...." The logical ending
of such an act would have been a clause prohibiting the participation
of Rhode Island citizens in the slave-trade. Not
only was such a clause omitted, but the following was inserted
instead: "Provided, also, that nothing in this act shall
extend, or be deemed to extend, to any negro or mulatto

or mulatto slave could not be disposed of in the West

the owner of such negro or mulatto slave give bond ...
that such negro or mulatto slave shall be exported out of the
colony, within one year from the date of such bond; if such
negro or mulatto be alive, and in a condition to be removed."<a name="FNanchor_41_156" id="FNanchor_41_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_156" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>In 1779 an act to prevent the sale of slaves out of the State
was passed,<a name="FNanchor_42_157" id="FNanchor_42_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_157" class="fnanchor">42</a> and in 1784, an act gradually to abolish slavery.<a name="FNanchor_43_158" id="FNanchor_43_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_158" class="fnanchor">43</a>
Not until 1787 did an act pass to forbid participation in the
slave-trade. This law laid a penalty of &pound;100 for every slave
transported and &pound;1000 for every vessel so engaged.<a name="FNanchor_44_159" id="FNanchor_44_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_159" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<p>21. <b>Restrictions in Connecticut.</b> Connecticut, in common
with the other colonies of this section, had a trade for many
years with the West Indian slave markets; and though this
trade was much smaller than that of the neighboring colonies,
yet many of her citizens were engaged in it. A map of
Middletown at the time of the Revolution gives, among one
hundred families, three slave captains and "three notables"
designated as "slave-dealers."<a name="FNanchor_45_160" id="FNanchor_45_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_160" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The actual importation was small,<a name="FNanchor_46_161" id="FNanchor_46_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_161" class="fnanchor">46</a> and almost entirely un<!-- Page 44 --><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">44</span>restricted
before the Revolution, save by a few light, general
duty acts. In 1774 the further importation of slaves was prohibited,
because "the increase of slaves in this Colony is injurious
to the poor and inconvenient." The law prohibited
importation under any pretext by a penalty of &pound;100 per slave.<a name="FNanchor_47_162" id="FNanchor_47_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_162" class="fnanchor">47</a>
This was re-enacted in 1784, and provisions were made for the
abolition of slavery.<a name="FNanchor_48_163" id="FNanchor_48_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_163" class="fnanchor">48</a> In 1788 participation in the trade was
forbidden, and the penalty placed at &pound;50 for each slave and
&pound;500 for each ship engaged.<a name="FNanchor_49_164" id="FNanchor_49_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_164" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>


<p>22. <b>General Character of these Restrictions.</b> Enough has
already been said to show, in the main, the character of the opposition
to the slave-trade in New England. The system of slavery
had, on this soil and amid these surroundings, no economic
justification, and the small number of Negroes here furnished
no political arguments against them. The opposition to the importation
was therefore from the first based solely on moral
grounds, with some social arguments. As to the carrying trade,
however, the case was different. Here, too, a feeble moral opposition
was early aroused, but it was swept away by the immense
economic advantages of the slave traffic to a thrifty
seafaring community of traders. This trade no moral suasion,
not even the strong "Liberty" cry of the Revolution, was able
wholly to suppress, until the closing of the West Indian and
Southern markets cut off the demand for slaves.</p>

was fitted out in March, 1752, and carried, beside the captain, two mates and
six men, and a cargo of 8,220 gallons of rum, together with "African" iron,
flour, pots, tar, sugar, and provisions, shackles, shirts, and water. Proceeding
to Africa, the captain after some difficulty sold his cargo for slaves, and in
April, 1753, he is expected in Barbadoes, as the consignees write. They also
state that slaves are selling at &pound;33 to &pound;56 per head in lots. After a stormy and
dangerous voyage, Captain Lindsay arrived, June 17, 1753, with fifty-six slaves,
"all in helth &amp; fatt." He also had 40 oz. of gold dust, and 8 or 9 cwt. of
pepper. The net proceeds of the sale of all this was &pound;1,324 3<i>d.</i> The captain
then took on board 55 hhd. of molasses and 3 hhd. 27 bbl. of sugar, amounting
to &pound;911 77<i>s.</i> 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, received bills on Liverpool for the balance, and returned
in safety to Rhode Island. He had done so well that he was
immediately given a new ship and sent to Africa again. <i>American Historical

<p>23. <b>The Situation in 1774.</b> In the individual efforts of the
various colonies to suppress the African slave-trade there may
be traced certain general movements. First, from 1638 to 1664,
there was a tendency to take a high moral stand against the
traffic. This is illustrated in the laws of New England, in the
plans for the settlement of Delaware and, later, that of Georgia,
and in the protest of the German Friends. The second
period, from about 1664 to 1760, has no general unity, but is
marked by statutes laying duties varying in design from encouragement
to absolute prohibition, by some cases of moral
opposition, and by the slow but steady growth of a spirit
unfavorable to the long continuance of the trade. The last
colonial period, from about 1760 to 1787, is one of pronounced
effort to regulate, limit, or totally prohibit the
traffic. Beside these general movements, there are many waves
of legislation, easily distinguishable, which rolled over several
or all of the colonies at various times, such as the series of
high duties following the Assiento, and the acts inspired by
various Negro "plots."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the laws of the colonies before 1774
had no national unity, the peculiar circumstances of each colony
determining its legislation. With the outbreak of the Revolution
came unison in action with regard to the slave-trade,
as with regard to other matters, which may justly be called
national. It was, of course, a critical period,&mdash;a period when,
in the rapid upheaval of a few years, the complicated and diverse
forces of decades meet, combine, act, and react, until
<!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">46</span>the resultant seems almost the work of chance. In the settlement
of the fate of slavery and the slave-trade, however, the
real crisis came in the calm that succeeded the storm, in that
day when, in the opinion of most men, the question seemed
already settled. And indeed it needed an exceptionally clear
and discerning mind, in 1787, to deny that slavery and the
slave-trade in the United States of America were doomed to
early annihilation. It seemed certainly a legitimate deduction
from the history of the preceding century to conclude that, as
the system had risen, flourished, and fallen in Massachusetts,
New York, and Pennsylvania, and as South Carolina, Virginia,
and Maryland were apparently following in the same
legislative path, the next generation would in all probability
witness the last throes of the system on our soil.</p>

<p>To be sure, the problem had its uncertain quantities. The
motives of the law-makers in South Carolina and Pennsylvania
were dangerously different; the century of industrial
expansion was slowly dawning and awakening that vast
economic revolution in which American slavery was to play
so prominent and fatal a r&ocirc;le; and, finally, there were already
in the South faint signs of a changing moral attitude toward
slavery, which would no longer regard the system as a temporary
makeshift, but rather as a permanent though perhaps
unfortunate necessity. With regard to the slave-trade, however,
there appeared to be substantial unity of opinion; and
there were, in 1787, few things to indicate that a cargo of five
hundred African slaves would openly be landed in Georgia in
1860.</p>


<p>24. <b>The Condition of the Slave-Trade.</b> In 1760 England,
the chief slave-trading nation, was sending on an average to
Africa 163 ships annually, with a tonnage of 18,000 tons, carrying
exports to the value of &pound;163,818. Only about twenty of
these ships regularly returned to England. Most of them carried
slaves to the West Indies, and returned laden with sugar
and other products. Thus may be formed some idea of the
size and importance of the slave-trade at that time, although
for a complete view we must add to this the trade under the
French, Portuguese, Dutch, and Americans. The trade fell
off somewhat toward 1770, but was flourishing again when
the Revolution brought a sharp and serious check upon it,
<!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">47</span>bringing down the number of English slavers, clearing, from
167 in 1774 to 28 in 1779, and the tonnage from 17,218 to 3,475
tons. After the war the trade gradually recovered, and by 1786
had reached nearly its former extent. In 1783 the British West
Indies received 16,208 Negroes from Africa, and by 1787 the
importation had increased to 21,023. In this latter year it was
estimated that the British were taking annually from Africa
38,000 slaves; the French, 20,000; the Portuguese, 10,000; the
Dutch and Danes, 6,000; a total of 74,000. Manchester alone
sent &pound;180,000 annually in goods to Africa in exchange for
Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_1_165" id="FNanchor_1_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_165" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>


<p>25. <b>The Slave-Trade and the "Association."</b> At the outbreak
of the Revolution six main reasons, some of which were
old and of slow growth, others peculiar to the abnormal situation
of that time, led to concerted action against the slave-trade.
The first reason was the economic failure of slavery in
the Middle and Eastern colonies; this gave rise to the presumption
that like failure awaited the institution in the South.
Secondly, the new philosophy of "Freedom" and the "Rights
of man," which formed the corner-stone of the Revolution,
made the dullest realize that, at the very least, the slave-trade
and a struggle for "liberty" were not consistent. Thirdly, the
old fear of slave insurrections, which had long played so
prominent a part in legislation, now gained new power from
the imminence of war and from the well-founded fear that
the British might incite servile uprisings. Fourthly, nearly all
the American slave markets were, in 1774&ndash;1775, overstocked
with slaves, and consequently many of the strongest partisans
of the system were "bulls" on the market, and desired to raise
the value of their slaves by at least a temporary stoppage of
the trade. Fifthly, since the vested interests of the slave-trading
merchants were liable to be swept away by the opening
of hostilities, and since the price of slaves was low,<a name="FNanchor_2_166" id="FNanchor_2_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_166" class="fnanchor">2</a> there was
from this quarter little active opposition to a cessation of the
trade for a season. Finally, it was long a favorite belief of the
supporters of the Revolution that, as English exploitation of
<!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">48</span>colonial resources had caused the quarrel, the best weapon to
bring England to terms was the economic expedient of stopping
all commercial intercourse with her. Since, then, the
slave-trade had ever formed an important part of her colonial
traffic, it was one of the first branches of commerce which
occurred to the colonists as especially suited to their ends.<a name="FNanchor_3_167" id="FNanchor_3_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_167" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Such were the complicated moral, political, and economic
motives which underlay the first national action against the
slave-trade. This action was taken by the "Association," a
union of the colonies entered into to enforce the policy of
stopping commercial intercourse with England. The movement
was not a great moral protest against an iniquitous
traffic; although it had undoubtedly a strong moral backing,
it was primarily a temporary war measure.</p>


<p>26. <b>The Action of the Colonies.</b> The earlier and largely
abortive attempts to form non-intercourse associations generally
did not mention slaves specifically, although the Virginia
House of Burgesses, May 11, 1769, recommended to
merchants and traders, among other things, to agree, "That
they will not import any slaves, or purchase any imported
after the first day of November next, until the said acts are
repealed."<a name="FNanchor_4_168" id="FNanchor_4_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_168" class="fnanchor">4</a> Later, in 1774, when a Faneuil Hall meeting
started the first successful national attempt at non-intercourse,
the slave-trade, being at the time especially flourishing, received
more attention. Even then slaves were specifically mentioned
in the resolutions of but three States. Rhode Island
recommended a stoppage of "all trade with Great Britain, Ireland,
Africa and the West Indies."<a name="FNanchor_5_169" id="FNanchor_5_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_169" class="fnanchor">5</a> North Carolina, in August,
1774, resolved in convention "That we will not import
any slave or slaves, or purchase any slave or slaves, imported
or brought into this Province by others, from any part of the
world, after the first day of <i>November</i> next."<a name="FNanchor_6_170" id="FNanchor_6_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_170" class="fnanchor">6</a> Virginia gave
the slave-trade especial prominence, and was in reality the
<!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum">49</span>leading spirit to force her views on the Continental Congress.
The county conventions of that colony first took up the subject.
Fairfax County thought "that during our present difficulties
and distress, no slaves ought to be imported," and
said: "We take this opportunity of declaring our most earnest
wishes to see an entire stop forever put to such a wicked,
cruel, and unnatural trade."<a name="FNanchor_7_171" id="FNanchor_7_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_171" class="fnanchor">7</a> Prince George and Nansemond
Counties resolved "That the <i>African</i> trade is injurious to this
Colony, obstructs the population of it by freemen, prevents
manufacturers and other useful emigrants from <i>Europe</i> from
settling amongst us, and occasions an annual increase of the
balance of trade against this Colony."<a name="FNanchor_8_172" id="FNanchor_8_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_172" class="fnanchor">8</a> The Virginia colonial
convention, August, 1774, also declared: "We will neither ourselves
import, nor purchase any slave or slaves imported by
any other person, after the first day of <i>November</i> next, either
from <i>Africa</i>, the <i>West Indies</i>, or any other place."<a name="FNanchor_9_173" id="FNanchor_9_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_173" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In South Carolina, at the convention July 6, 1774, decided
opposition to the non-importation scheme was manifested,
though how much this was due to the slave-trade interest is
not certain. Many of the delegates wished at least to limit the
powers of their representatives, and the Charleston Chamber
of Commerce flatly opposed the plan of an "Association."
Finally, however, delegates with full powers were sent to
Congress. The arguments leading to this step were not in all
cases on the score of patriotism; a Charleston manifesto argued:
"The planters are greatly in arrears to the merchants; a
stoppage of importation would give them all an opportunity
to extricate themselves from debt. The merchants would have
time to settle their accounts, and be ready with the return of
liberty to renew trade."<a name="FNanchor_10_174" id="FNanchor_10_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_174" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>


<p>27. <b>The Action of the Continental Congress.</b> The first
Continental Congress met September 5, 1774, and on September
22 recommended merchants to send no more orders for
foreign goods.<a name="FNanchor_11_175" id="FNanchor_11_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_175" class="fnanchor">11</a> On September 27 "Mr. Lee made a motion
for a non-importation," and it was unanimously resolved to
<!-- Page 50 --><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">50</span>import no goods from Great Britain after December 1, 1774.<a name="FNanchor_12_176" id="FNanchor_12_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_176" class="fnanchor">12</a>
Afterward, Ireland and the West Indies were also included,
and a committee consisting of Low of New York, Mifflin of
Pennsylvania, Lee of Virginia, and Johnson of Connecticut
were appointed "to bring in a Plan for carrying into Effect
the Non-importation, Non-consumption, and Non-exportation
resolved on."<a name="FNanchor_13_177" id="FNanchor_13_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_177" class="fnanchor">13</a> The next move was to instruct this committee
to include in the proscribed articles, among other
things, "Molasses, Coffee or Piemento from the <i>British</i> Plantations
or from <i>Dominica</i>,"&mdash;a motion which cut deep into
the slave-trade circle of commerce, and aroused some opposition.
"Will, can, the people bear a total interruption of the
West India trade?" asked Low of New York; "Can they live
without rum, sugar, and molasses? Will not this impatience
and vexation defeat the measure?"<a name="FNanchor_14_178" id="FNanchor_14_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_178" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The committee finally reported, October 12, 1774, and after
three days' discussion and amendment the proposal passed.
This document, after a recital of grievances, declared that, in
the opinion of the colonists, a non-importation agreement
would best secure redress; goods from Great Britain, Ireland,
the East and West Indies, and Dominica were excluded; and
it was resolved that "We will neither import, nor purchase any
Slave imported after the First Day of <i>December</i> next; after
which Time, we will wholly discontinue the Slave Trade, and
will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our
Vessels, nor sell our Commodities or Manufactures to those
who are concerned in it."<a name="FNanchor_15_179" id="FNanchor_15_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_179" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Strong and straightforward as this resolution was, time unfortunately
proved that it meant very little. Two years later,
in this same Congress, a decided opposition was manifested
to branding the slave-trade as inhuman, and it was thirteen
years before South Carolina stopped the slave-trade or Massachusetts
prohibited her citizens from engaging in it. The
passing of so strong a resolution must be explained by the
motives before given, by the character of the drafting com<!-- Page 51 --><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">51</span>mittee,
by the desire of America in this crisis to appear well
before the world, and by the natural moral enthusiasm
aroused by the imminence of a great national struggle.</p>


<p>28. <b>Reception of the Slave-Trade Resolution.</b> The unanimity
with which the colonists received this "Association" is
not perhaps as remarkable as the almost entire absence of
comment on the radical slave-trade clause. A Connecticut
town-meeting in December, 1774, noticed "with singular
pleasure ... the second Article of the Association, in which
it is agreed to import no more Negro Slaves."<a name="FNanchor_16_180" id="FNanchor_16_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_180" class="fnanchor">16</a> This comment
appears to have been almost the only one. There were in various
places some evidences of disapproval; but only in the
State of Georgia was this widespread and determined, and
based mainly on the slave-trade clause.<a name="FNanchor_17_181" id="FNanchor_17_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_181" class="fnanchor">17</a> This opposition delayed
the ratification meeting until January 18, 1775, and then
delegates from but five of the twelve parishes appeared, and
many of these had strong instructions against the approval of
the plan. Before this meeting could act, the governor adjourned
it, on the ground that it did not represent the province.
Some of the delegates signed an agreement, one article
of which promised to stop the importation of slaves March
15, 1775, i.e., four months later than the national "Association"
had directed. This was not, of course, binding on the province;
and although a town like Darien might declare "our
disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural practice of
Slavery in <i>America</i>"<a name="FNanchor_18_182" id="FNanchor_18_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_182" class="fnanchor">18</a> yet the powerful influence of Savannah
was "not likely soon to give matters a favourable turn. The
importers were mostly against any interruption, and the consumers
very much divided."<a name="FNanchor_19_183" id="FNanchor_19_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_183" class="fnanchor">19</a> Thus the efforts of this Assembly
failed, their resolutions being almost unknown, and, as a
gentleman writes, "I hope for the honour of the Province ever
will remain so."<a name="FNanchor_20_184" id="FNanchor_20_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_184" class="fnanchor">20</a> The delegates to the Continental Congress
selected by this rump assembly refused to take their seats.<!-- Page 52 --><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">52</span>
Meantime South Carolina stopped trade with Georgia, because
it "hath not acceded to the Continental Association,"<a name="FNanchor_21_185" id="FNanchor_21_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_185" class="fnanchor">21</a>
and the single Georgia parish of St. Johns appealed to the
second Continental Congress to except it from the general
boycott of the colony. This county had already resolved not
to "purchase any Slave imported at <i>Savannah</i> (large Numbers
of which we understand are there expected) till the Sense of
Congress shall be made known to us."<a name="FNanchor_22_186" id="FNanchor_22_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_186" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>May 17, 1775, Congress resolved unanimously "That all exportations
to <i>Quebec</i>, <i>Nova-Scotia</i>, the Island of <i>St. John's</i>,
<i>Newfoundland</i>, <i>Georgia</i>, except the Parish of <i>St. John's</i>, and to
<i>East</i> and <i>West Florida</i>, immediately cease."<a name="FNanchor_23_187" id="FNanchor_23_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_187" class="fnanchor">23</a> These measures
brought the refractory colony to terms, and the Provincial
Congress, July 4, 1775, finally adopted the "Association," and
resolved, among other things, "That we will neither import
or purchase any Slave imported from Africa, or elsewhere,
after this day."<a name="FNanchor_24_188" id="FNanchor_24_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_188" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The non-importation agreement was in the beginning, at
least, well enforced by the voluntary action of the loosely federated
nation. The slave-trade clause seems in most States to
have been observed with the others. In South Carolina "a
cargo of near three hundred slaves was sent out of the Colony
by the consignee, as being interdicted by the second article of
the Association."<a name="FNanchor_25_189" id="FNanchor_25_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_189" class="fnanchor">25</a> In Virginia the vigilance committee of
Norfolk "hold up for your just indignation Mr. <i>John Brown</i>,
Merchant, of this place," who has several times imported
slaves from Jamaica; and he is thus publicly censured "to the
end that all such foes to the rights of <i>British America</i> may be
publickly known ... as the enemies of <i>American</i> Liberty,
and that every person may henceforth break off all dealings
with him."<a name="FNanchor_26_190" id="FNanchor_26_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_190" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>


<p>29. <b>Results of the Resolution.</b> The strain of war at last
proved too much for this voluntary blockade, and after some
<!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">53</span>hesitancy Congress, April 3, 1776, resolved to allow the importation
of articles not the growth or manufacture of Great
Britain, except tea. They also voted "That no slaves be imported
into any of the thirteen United Colonies."<a name="FNanchor_27_191" id="FNanchor_27_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_191" class="fnanchor">27</a> This marks
a noticeable change of attitude from the strong words of two
years previous: the former was a definitive promise; this is a
temporary resolve, which probably represented public opinion
much better than the former. On the whole, the conclusion
is inevitably forced on the student of this first national
movement against the slave-trade, that its influence on the
trade was but temporary and insignificant, and that at the end
of the experiment the outlook for the final suppression of the
trade was little brighter than before. The whole movement
served as a sort of social test of the power and importance of
the slave-trade, which proved to be far more powerful than
the platitudes of many of the Revolutionists had assumed.</p>

<p>The effect of the movement on the slave-trade in general
was to begin, possibly a little earlier than otherwise would
have been the case, that temporary breaking up of the trade
which the war naturally caused. "There was a time, during
the late war," says Clarkson, "when the slave trade may be
considered as having been nearly abolished."<a name="FNanchor_28_192" id="FNanchor_28_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_192" class="fnanchor">28</a> The prices of
slaves rose correspondingly high, so that smugglers made fortunes.<a name="FNanchor_29_193" id="FNanchor_29_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_193" class="fnanchor">29</a>
It is stated that in the years 1772&ndash;1778 slave merchants
of Liverpool failed for the sum of &pound;710,000.<a name="FNanchor_30_194" id="FNanchor_30_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_194" class="fnanchor">30</a> All this, of
course, might have resulted from the war, without the "Association;"
but in the long run the "Association" aided in
frustrating the very designs which the framers of the first resolve
had in mind; for the temporary stoppage in the end
created an extraordinary demand for slaves, and led to a slave-trade
after the war nearly as large as that before.</p>


<p>30. <b>The Slave-Trade and Public Opinion after the War.</b>
The Declaration of Independence showed a significant drift
of public opinion from the firm stand taken in the "Association"
resolutions. The clique of political philosophers to
which Jefferson belonged never imagined the continued exis<!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">54</span>tence
of the country with slavery. It is well known that the
first draft of the Declaration contained a severe arraignment
of Great Britain as the real promoter of slavery and the slave-trade
in America. In it the king was charged with waging
"cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred
rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people
who never offended him, captivating and carrying them
into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable
death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare,
the opprobrium of <i>infidel</i> powers, is the warfare of the <i>Christian</i>
king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market
where <i>men</i> should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his
negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit
or to restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage
of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he
is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us,
and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them,
by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them:
thus paying off former crimes committed against the <i>liberties</i>
of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit
against the <i>lives</i> of another."<a name="FNanchor_31_195" id="FNanchor_31_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_195" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>To this radical and not strictly truthful statement, even the
large influence of the Virginia leaders could not gain the assent
of the delegates in Congress. The afflatus of 1774 was
rapidly subsiding, and changing economic conditions had already
led many to look forward to a day when the slave-trade
could successfully be reopened. More important than this, the
nation as a whole was even less inclined now than in 1774 to
denounce the slave-trade uncompromisingly. Jefferson himself
says that this clause "was struck out in complaisance to South
Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain
the importation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still
wished to continue it. Our northern brethren also, I believe,"
said he, "felt a little tender under those censures; for though
their people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been
pretty considerable carriers of them to others."<a name="FNanchor_32_196" id="FNanchor_32_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_196" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>As the war slowly dragged itself to a close, it became in<!-- Page 55 --><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum">55</span>creasingly
evident that a firm moral stand against slavery and
the slave-trade was not a probability. The reaction which naturally
follows a period of prolonged and exhausting strife for
high political principles now set in. The economic forces of
the country, which had suffered most, sought to recover and
rearrange themselves; and all the selfish motives that impelled
a bankrupt nation to seek to gain its daily bread did not long
hesitate to demand a reopening of the profitable African
slave-trade. This demand was especially urgent from the fact
that the slaves, by pillage, flight, and actual fighting, had become
so reduced in numbers during the war that an urgent
demand for more laborers was felt in the South.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the revival of the trade was naturally a matter
of some difficulty, as the West India circuit had been cut off,
leaving no resort except to contraband traffic and the direct
African trade. The English slave-trade after the peace "returned
to its former state," and was by 1784 sending 20,000
slaves annually to the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_33_197" id="FNanchor_33_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_197" class="fnanchor">33</a> Just how large the trade
to the continent was at this time there are few means of ascertaining;
it is certain that there was a general reopening of
the trade in the Carolinas and Georgia, and that the New
England traders participated in it. This traffic undoubtedly
reached considerable proportions; and through the direct
African trade and the illicit West India trade many thousands
of Negroes came into the United States during the
years 1783&ndash;1787.<a name="FNanchor_34_198" id="FNanchor_34_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_198" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Meantime there was slowly arising a significant divergence
of opinion on the subject. Probably the whole country still
regarded both slavery and the slave-trade as temporary; but
the Middle States expected to see the abolition of both within
a generation, while the South scarcely thought it probable to
prohibit even the slave-trade in that short time. Such a difference
might, in all probability, have been satisfactorily adjusted,
if both parties had recognized the real gravity of the
matter. As it was, both regarded it as a problem of secondary
importance, to be solved after many other more pressing ones
<!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum">56</span>had been disposed of. The anti-slavery men had seen slavery
die in their own communities, and expected it to die the same
way in others, with as little active effort on their own part.
The Southern planters, born and reared in a slave system,
thought that some day the system might change, and possibly
disappear; but active effort to this end on their part was ever
farthest from their thoughts. Here, then, began that fatal policy
toward slavery and the slave-trade that characterized the
nation for three-quarters of a century, the policy of <i>laissez-faire,
laissez-passer</i>.</p>


<p>31. <b>The Action of the Confederation.</b> The slave-trade was
hardly touched upon in the Congress of the Confederation,
except in the ordinance respecting the capture of slaves, and
on the occasion of the Quaker petition against the trade, although,
during the debate on the Articles of Confederation,
the counting of slaves as well as of freemen in the apportionment
of taxes was urged as a measure that would check further
importation of Negroes. "It is our duty," said Wilson of
Pennsylvania, "to lay every discouragement on the importation
of slaves; but this amendment [i.e., to count two slaves
as one freeman] would give the <i>jus trium liberorum</i> to him
who would import slaves."<a name="FNanchor_35_199" id="FNanchor_35_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_199" class="fnanchor">35</a> The matter was finally compromised
by apportioning requisitions according to the value of
land and buildings.</p>

<p>After the Articles went into operation, an ordinance in regard
to the recapture of fugitive slaves provided that, if the
capture was made on the sea below high-water mark, and the
Negro was not claimed, he should be freed. Matthews of
South Carolina demanded the yeas and nays on this proposition,
with the result that only the vote of his State was recorded
against it.<a name="FNanchor_36_200" id="FNanchor_36_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_200" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 3, 1783, a deputation from the Yearly
Meeting of the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware
Friends asked leave to present a petition. Leave was granted
the following day,<a name="FNanchor_37_201" id="FNanchor_37_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_201" class="fnanchor">37</a> but no further minute appears. According
to the report of the Friends, the petition was against the
<!-- Page 57 --><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">57</span>slave-trade; and "though the Christian rectitude of the concern
was by the Delegates generally acknowledged, yet not
being vested with the powers of legislation, they declined
promoting any public remedy against the gross national iniquity
of trafficking in the persons of fellow-men."<a name="FNanchor_38_202" id="FNanchor_38_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_202" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The only legislative activity in regard to the trade during
the Confederation was taken by the individual States.<a name="FNanchor_39_203" id="FNanchor_39_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_203" class="fnanchor">39</a> Before
1778 Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia
had by law stopped the further importation of slaves,
and importation had practically ceased in all the New England
and Middle States, including Maryland. In consequence
of the revival of the slave-trade after the War, there was then
a lull in State activity until 1786, when North Carolina laid a
prohibitive duty, and South Carolina, a year later, began her
series of temporary prohibitions. In 1787&ndash;1788 the New England
States forbade the participation of their citizens in the
traffic. It was this wave of legislation against the traffic which
did so much to blind the nation as to the strong hold which
slavery still had on the country.</p>

<p>32. <b>The First Proposition.</b> Slavery occupied no prominent
place in the Convention called to remedy the glaring defects
of the Confederation, for the obvious reason that few of the
delegates thought it expedient to touch a delicate subject
which, if let alone, bade fair to settle itself in a manner satisfactory
to all. Consequently, neither slavery nor the slave-trade
is specifically mentioned in the delegates' credentials of
any of the States, nor in Randolph's, Pinckney's, or Hamilton's
plans, nor in Paterson's propositions. Indeed, the debate
from May 14 to June 19, when the Committee of the Whole
reported, touched the subject only in the matter of the ratio
of representation of slaves. With this same exception, the report
of the Committee of the Whole contained no reference
to slavery or the slave-trade, and the twenty-three resolutions
of the Convention referred to the Committee of Detail, July
23 and 26, maintain the same silence.</p>

<p>The latter committee, consisting of Rutledge, Randolph,
Gorham, Ellsworth, and Wilson, reported a draft of the Constitution
August 6, 1787. The committee had, in its deliberations,
probably made use of a draft of a national Constitution
made by Edmund Randolph.<a name="FNanchor_1_204" id="FNanchor_1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_204" class="fnanchor">1</a> One clause of this provided
that "no State shall lay a duty on imports;" and, also, "1. No
duty on exports. 2. No prohibition on such inhabitants as the
United States think proper to admit. 3. No duties by way of
such prohibition." It does not appear that any reference to
Negroes was here intended. In the extant copy, however,
<!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pagenum">59</span>notes in Edward Rutledge's handwriting change the second
clause to "No prohibition on such inhabitants or people as
the several States think proper to admit."<a name="FNanchor_2_205" id="FNanchor_2_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_205" class="fnanchor">2</a> In the report, August
6, these clauses take the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Article VII. Section 4. No tax or duty shall be laid by the legislature
on articles exported from any state; nor on the migration or
importation of such persons as the several states shall think proper
to admit; nor shall such migration or importation be prohibited."<a name="FNanchor_3_206" id="FNanchor_3_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_206" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>


<p>33. <b>The General Debate.</b> This, of course, referred both to
immigrants ("migration") and to slaves ("importation").<a name="FNanchor_4_207" id="FNanchor_4_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_207" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Debate on this section began Tuesday, August 22, and lasted
two days. Luther Martin of Maryland precipitated the discussion
by a proposition to alter the section so as to allow a
prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves. The debate
immediately became general, being carried on principally by
Rutledge, the Pinckneys, and Williamson from the Carolinas;
Baldwin of Georgia; Mason, Madison, and Randolph of Virginia;
Wilson and Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania; Dickinson
of Delaware; and Ellsworth, Sherman, Gerry, King,
and Langdon of New England.<a name="FNanchor_5_208" id="FNanchor_5_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_208" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>In this debate the moral arguments were prominent. Colonel
George Mason of Virginia denounced the traffic in slaves
as "infernal;" Luther Martin of Maryland regarded it as "inconsistent
with the principles of the revolution, and dishonorable
to the American character." "Every principle of honor
and safety," declared John Dickinson of Delaware, "demands
the exclusion of slaves." Indeed, Mason solemnly averred that
the crime of slavery might yet bring the judgment of God on
the nation. On the other side, Rutledge of South Carolina
bluntly declared that religion and humanity had nothing to
do with the question, that it was a matter of "interest" alone.
Gerry of Massachusetts wished merely to refrain from giving
direct sanction to the trade, while others contented themselves
with pointing out the inconsistency of condemning the
slave-trade and defending slavery.</p><p><!-- Page 60 --><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum">60</span></p>

<p>The difficulty of the whole argument, from the moral
standpoint, lay in the fact that it was completely checkmated
by the obstinate attitude of South Carolina and Georgia.
Their delegates&mdash;Baldwin, the Pinckneys, Rutledge, and others&mdash;asserted
flatly, not less than a half-dozen times during
the debate, that these States "can never receive the plan if it
prohibits the slave-trade;" that "if the Convention thought"
that these States would consent to a stoppage of the slave-trade,
"the expectation is vain."<a name="FNanchor_6_209" id="FNanchor_6_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_209" class="fnanchor">6</a> By this stand all argument
from the moral standpoint was virtually silenced, for the Convention
evidently agreed with Roger Sherman of Connecticut
that "it was better to let the Southern States import slaves
than to part with those States."</p>

<p>In such a dilemma the Convention listened not unwillingly
to the <i>non possumus</i> arguments of the States' Rights advocates.
The "morality and wisdom" of slavery, declared Ellsworth
of Connecticut, "are considerations belonging to the
States themselves;" let every State "import what it pleases;"
the Confederation has not "meddled" with the question, why
should the Union? It is a dangerous symptom of centralization,
cried Baldwin of Georgia; the "central States" wish to
be the "vortex for everything," even matters of "a local nature."
The national government, said Gerry of Massachusetts,
had nothing to do with slavery in the States; it had only to
refrain from giving direct sanction to the system. Others opposed
this whole argument, declaring, with Langdon of New
Hampshire, that Congress ought to have this power, since, as
Dickinson tartly remarked, "The true question was, whether
the national happiness would be promoted or impeded by the
importation; and this question ought to be left to the national
government, not to the states particularly interested."</p>

<p>Beside these arguments as to the right of the trade and the
proper seat of authority over it, many arguments of general
expediency were introduced. From an economic standpoint,
for instance, General C.C. Pinckney of South Carolina "contended,
that the importation of slaves would be for the interest
of the whole Union. The more slaves, the more produce."
Rutledge of the same State declared: "If the Northern States
<!-- Page 61 --><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">61</span>consult their interest, they will not oppose the increase of
slaves, which will increase the commodities of which they will
become the carriers." This sentiment found a more or less
conscious echo in the words of Ellsworth of Connecticut,
"What enriches a part enriches the whole." It was, moreover,
broadly hinted that the zeal of Maryland and Virginia against
the trade had an economic rather than a humanitarian motive,
since they had slaves enough and to spare, and wished to sell
them at a high price to South Carolina and Georgia, who
needed more. In such case restrictions would unjustly discriminate
against the latter States. The argument from history
was barely touched upon. Only once was there an allusion to
"the example of all the world" "in all ages" to justify slavery,<a name="FNanchor_7_210" id="FNanchor_7_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_210" class="fnanchor">7</a>
and once came the counter declaration that "Greece and
Rome were made unhappy by their slaves."<a name="FNanchor_8_211" id="FNanchor_8_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_211" class="fnanchor">8</a> On the other
hand, the military weakness of slavery in the late war led to
many arguments on that score. Luther Martin and George
Mason dwelt on the danger of a servile class in war and insurrection;
while Rutledge hotly replied that he "would readily
exempt the other states from the obligation to protect the
Southern against them;" and Ellsworth thought that the very
danger would "become a motive to kind treatment." The desirability
of keeping slavery out of the West was once mentioned
as an argument against the trade: to this all seemed
tacitly to agree.<a name="FNanchor_9_212" id="FNanchor_9_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_212" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Throughout the debate it is manifest that the Convention
had no desire really to enter upon a general slavery argument.
The broader and more theoretic aspects of the question were
but lightly touched upon here and there. Undoubtedly, most
of the members would have much preferred not to raise the
question at all; but, as it was raised, the differences of opinion
were too manifest to be ignored, and the Convention, after
its first perplexity, gradually and perhaps too willingly set itself
to work to find some "middle ground" on which all parties
could stand. The way to this compromise was pointed out
by the South. The most radical pro-slavery arguments always
ended with the opinion that "if the Southern States were let
<!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">62</span>alone, they will probably of themselves stop importations."<a name="FNanchor_10_213" id="FNanchor_10_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_213" class="fnanchor">10</a>
To be sure, General Pinckney admitted that, "candidly, he did
not think South Carolina would stop her importations of
slaves in any short time;" nevertheless, the Convention "observed,"
with Roger Sherman, "that the abolition of slavery
seemed to be going on in the United States, and that the
good sense of the several states would probably by degrees
complete it." Economic forces were evoked to eke out moral
motives: when the South had its full quota of slaves, like Virginia
it too would abolish the trade; free labor was bound
finally to drive out slave labor. Thus the chorus of "<i>laissez-faire</i>"
increased; and compromise seemed at least in sight,
when Connecticut cried, "Let the trade alone!" and Georgia
denounced it as an "evil." Some few discordant notes were
heard, as, for instance, when Wilson of Pennsylvania made
the uncomforting remark, "If South Carolina and Georgia
were themselves disposed to get rid of the importation of
slaves in a short time, as had been suggested, they would
never refuse to unite because the importation might be prohibited."</p>

<p>With the spirit of compromise in the air, it was not long
before the general terms were clear. The slavery side was
strongly intrenched, and had a clear and definite demand. The
forces of freedom were, on the contrary, divided by important
conflicts of interest, and animated by no very strong and
decided anti-slavery spirit with settled aims. Under such circumstances,
it was easy for the Convention to miss the
opportunity for a really great compromise, and to descend to
a scheme that savored unpleasantly of "log-rolling." The student
of the situation will always have good cause to believe
that a more sturdy and definite anti-slavery stand at this point
might have changed history for the better.</p>


<p>34. <b>The Special Committee and the "Bargain."</b> Since the
debate had, in the first place, arisen from a proposition to tax
the importation of slaves, the yielding of this point by the
South was the first move toward compromise. To all but the
doctrinaires, who shrank from taxing men as property, the
argument that the failure to tax slaves was equivalent to a
<!-- Page 63 --><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum">63</span>bounty, was conclusive. With this point settled, Randolph
voiced the general sentiment, when he declared that he "was
for committing, in order that some middle ground might, if
possible, be found." Finally, Gouverneur Morris discovered
the "middle ground," in his suggestion that the whole subject
be committed, "including the clauses relating to taxes on exports
and to a navigation act. These things," said he, "may
form a bargain among the Northern and Southern States."
This was quickly assented to; and sections four and five, on
slave-trade and capitation tax, were committed by a vote of 7
to 3,<a name="FNanchor_11_214" id="FNanchor_11_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_214" class="fnanchor">11</a> and section six, on navigation acts, by a vote of 9 to 2.<a name="FNanchor_12_215" id="FNanchor_12_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_215" class="fnanchor">12</a>
All three clauses were referred to the following committee:
Langdon of New Hampshire, King of Massachusetts, Johnson
of Connecticut, Livingston of New Jersey, Clymer of
Pennsylvania, Dickinson of Delaware, Martin of Maryland,
Madison of Virginia, Williamson of North Carolina, General
Pinckney of South Carolina, and Baldwin of Georgia.</p>

<p>The fullest account of the proceedings of this committee is
given in Luther Martin's letter to his constituents, and is confirmed
in its main particulars by similar reports of other delegates.
Martin writes: "A committee of <i>one</i> member from
each state was chosen by ballot, to take this part of the system
under their consideration, and to endeavor to agree upon
some report which should reconcile those states [i.e., South
Carolina and Georgia]. To this committee also was referred
the following proposition, which had been reported by the
committee of detail, viz.: 'No navigation act shall be passed
without the assent of two thirds of the members present in
each house'&mdash;a proposition which the staple and commercial
states were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce should be
placed too much under the power of the Eastern States, but
which these last States were as anxious to reject. This committee&mdash;of
which also I had the honor to be a member&mdash;met,
and took under their consideration the subjects committed
to them. I found the <i>Eastern</i> States, notwithstanding their
<i>aversion to slavery</i>, were very willing to indulge the Southern<!-- Page 64 --><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">64</span>
States at least with a temporary liberty to prosecute the slave
trade, provided the Southern States would, in their turn, gratify
<i>them</i>, by laying no restriction on navigation acts; and after
a very little time, the committee, by a great majority, agreed
on a report, by which the general government was to be prohibited
from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited
time, and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts
was to be omitted."<a name="FNanchor_13_216" id="FNanchor_13_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_216" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>That the "bargain" was soon made is proven by the fact
that the committee reported the very next day, Friday, August
24, and that on Saturday the report was taken up. It was as
follows: "Strike out so much of the fourth section as was referred
to the committee, and insert 'The migration or importation
of such persons as the several states, now existing, shall
think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the legislature
prior to the year 1800; but a tax or duty may be imposed
on such migration or importation, at a rate not exceeding the
average of the duties laid on imports.' The fifth section to
remain as in the report. The sixth section to be stricken out."<a name="FNanchor_14_217" id="FNanchor_14_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_217" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>


<p>35. <b>The Appeal to the Convention.</b> The ensuing debate,<a name="FNanchor_15_218" id="FNanchor_15_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_218" class="fnanchor">15</a>
which lasted only a part of the day, was evidently a sort of
appeal to the House on the decisions of the committee. It
throws light on the points of disagreement. General Pinckney
first proposed to extend the slave-trading limit to 1808, and
Gorham of Massachusetts seconded the motion. This brought
a spirited protest from Madison: "Twenty years will produce
all the mischief that can be apprehended from the liberty to
import slaves. So long a term will be more dishonorable to
the American character than to say nothing about it in the
Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_16_219" id="FNanchor_16_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_219" class="fnanchor">16</a> There was, however, evidently another "bargain"
here; for, without farther debate, the South and the
East voted the extension, 7 to 4, only New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, and Virginia objecting. The ambiguous phraseology
of the whole slave-trade section as reported did not
pass without comment; Gouverneur Morris would have it
read: "The importation of slaves into North Carolina, South
<!-- Page 65 --><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pagenum">65</span>Carolina, and Georgia, shall not be prohibited," etc.<a name="FNanchor_17_220" id="FNanchor_17_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_220" class="fnanchor">17</a> This
emendation was, however, too painfully truthful for the doctrinaires,
and was, amid a score of objections, withdrawn. The
taxation clause also was manifestly too vague for practical use,
and Baldwin of Georgia wished to amend it by inserting
"common impost on articles not enumerated," in lieu of the
"average" duty.<a name="FNanchor_18_221" id="FNanchor_18_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_221" class="fnanchor">18</a> This minor point gave rise to considerable
argument: Sherman and Madison deprecated any such recognition
of property in man as taxing would imply; Mason
and Gorham argued that the tax restrained the trade; while
King, Langdon, and General Pinckney contented themselves
with the remark that this clause was "the price of the first
part." Finally, it was unanimously agreed to make the duty
"not exceeding ten dollars for each person."<a name="FNanchor_19_222" id="FNanchor_19_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_222" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Southern interests now being safe, some Southern members
attempted, a few days later, to annul the "bargain" by
restoring the requirement of a two-thirds vote in navigation
acts. Charles Pinckney made the motion, in an elaborate
speech designed to show the conflicting commercial interests
of the States; he declared that "The power of regulating commerce
was a pure concession on the part of the Southern
States."<a name="FNanchor_20_223" id="FNanchor_20_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_223" class="fnanchor">20</a> Martin and Williamson of North Carolina, Butler of
South Carolina, and Mason of Virginia defended the proposition,
insisting that it would be a dangerous concession on
the part of the South to leave navigation acts to a mere majority
vote. Sherman of Connecticut, Morris of Pennsylvania,
and Spaight of North Carolina declared that the very diversity
of interest was a security. Finally, by a vote of 7 to 4, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia being in the minority,
the Convention refused to consider the motion, and
the recommendation of the committee passed.<a name="FNanchor_21_224" id="FNanchor_21_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_224" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>When, on September 10, the Convention was discussing
the amendment clause of the Constitution, the ever-alert
Rutledge, perceiving that the results of the laboriously<!-- Page 66 --><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">66</span> settled
"bargain" might be endangered, declared that he "never could
agree to give a power by which the articles relating to slaves
might be altered by the states not interested in that property."<a name="FNanchor_22_225" id="FNanchor_22_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_225" class="fnanchor">22</a>
As a result, the clause finally adopted, September 15,
had the proviso: "Provided, that no amendment which may
be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the
1st and 4th clauses in the 9th section of the 1st article."<a name="FNanchor_23_226" id="FNanchor_23_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_226" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>


<p>36. <b>Settlement by the Convention.</b> Thus, the slave-trade
article of the Constitution stood finally as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Article I. Section 9. The Migration or Importation of such Persons
as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,
shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand
eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on
such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person."</p>

<p>This settlement of the slavery question brought out distinct
differences of moral attitude toward the institution, and yet
differences far from hopeless. To be sure, the South apologized
for slavery, the Middle States denounced it, and the
East could only tolerate it from afar; and yet all three sections
united in considering it a temporary institution, the corner-stone
of which was the slave-trade. No one of them had ever
seen a system of slavery without an active slave-trade; and
there were probably few members of the Convention who did
not believe that the foundations of slavery had been sapped
merely by putting the abolition of the slave-trade in the hands
of Congress twenty years hence. Here lay the danger; for
when the North called slavery "temporary," she thought of
twenty or thirty years, while the "temporary" period of the
South was scarcely less than a century. Meantime, for at least
a score of years, a policy of strict <i>laissez-faire</i>, so far as the
general government was concerned, was to intervene. Instead
of calling the whole moral energy of the people into action,
so as gradually to crush this portentous evil, the Federal Convention
lulled the nation to sleep by a "bargain," and left to
the vacillating and unripe judgment of the States one of the
most threatening of the social and political ills which they
<!-- Page 67 --><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">67</span>were so courageously seeking to remedy.</p>


<p>37. <b>Reception of the Clause by the Nation.</b> When the
proposed Constitution was before the country, the slave-trade
article came in for no small amount of condemnation and
apology. In the pamphlets of the day it was much discussed.
One of the points in Mason's "Letter of Objections" was that
"the general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further
importation of slaves for twenty odd years, though such
importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable,
and less capable of defence."<a name="FNanchor_24_227" id="FNanchor_24_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_227" class="fnanchor">24</a> To this Iredell replied,
through the columns of the <i>State Gazette</i> of North Carolina:
"If all the States had been willing to adopt this regulation
[i.e., to prohibit the slave-trade], I should as an individual
most heartily have approved of it, because even if the importation
of slaves in fact rendered us stronger, less vulnerable
and more capable of defence, I should rejoice in the prohibition
of it, as putting an end to a trade which has already
continued too long for the honor and humanity of those concerned
in it. But as it was well known that South Carolina
and Georgia thought a further continuance of such importations
useful to them, and would not perhaps otherwise have
agreed to the new constitution, those States which had been
importing till they were satisfied, could not with decency have
insisted upon their relinquishing advantages themselves had
already enjoyed. Our situation makes it necessary to bear the
evil as it is. It will be left to the future legislatures to allow
such importations or not. If any, in violation of their clear
conviction of the injustice of this trade, persist in pursuing it,
this is a matter between God and their own consciences. The
interests of humanity will, however, have gained something
by the prohibition of this inhuman trade, though at a distance
of twenty odd years."<a name="FNanchor_25_228" id="FNanchor_25_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_228" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>"Centinel," representing the Quaker sentiment of Pennsylvania,
attacked the clause in his third letter, published in the <i>Independent
Gazetteer, or The Chronicle of Freedom</i>, November 8,
1787: "We are told that the objects of this article are slaves, and
that it is inserted to secure to the southern states the right of
introducing negroes for twenty-one years to come, against the
<!-- Page 68 --><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">68</span>declared sense of the other states to put an end to an odious
traffic in the human species, which is especially scandalous
and inconsistent in a people, who have asserted their own liberty
by the sword, and which dangerously enfeebles the districts
wherein the laborers are bondsmen. The words, dark and
ambiguous, such as no plain man of common sense would
have used, are evidently chosen to conceal from Europe,
that in this enlightened country, the practice of slavery has its
advocates among men in the highest stations. When it is recollected
that no poll tax can be imposed on <i>five</i> negroes, above
what <i>three</i> whites shall be charged; when it is considered,
that the imposts on the consumption of Carolina field negroes
must be trifling, and the excise nothing, it is plain that the
proportion of contributions, which can be expected from the
southern states under the new constitution, will be unequal,
and yet they are to be allowed to enfeeble themselves by the
further importation of negroes till the year 1808. Has not the
concurrence of the five southern states (in the convention) to
the new system, been purchased too dearly by the rest?"<a name="FNanchor_26_229" id="FNanchor_26_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_229" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Noah Webster's "Examination" (1787) addressed itself to
such Quaker scruples: "But, say the enemies of slavery, negroes
may be imported for twenty-one years. This exception
is addressed to the quakers, and a very pitiful exception it is.
The truth is, Congress cannot prohibit the importation of
slaves during that period; but the laws against the importation
into particular states, stand unrepealed. An immediate
abolition of slavery would bring ruin upon the whites, and
misery upon the blacks, in the southern states. The constitution
has therefore wisely left each state to pursue its own measures,
with respect to this article of legislation, during the
period of twenty-one years."<a name="FNanchor_27_230" id="FNanchor_27_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_230" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The following year the "Examination" of Tench Coxe said:
"The temporary reservation of any particular matter must
ever be deemed an admission that it should be done away.
This appears to have been well understood. In addition to the
arguments drawn from liberty, justice and religion, opinions
against this practice [i.e., of slave-trading], founded in sound
<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum">69</span>policy, have no doubt been urged. Regard was necessarily
paid to the peculiar situation of our southern fellow-citizens;
but they, on the other hand, have not been insensible of the
delicate situation of our national character on this subject."<a name="FNanchor_28_231" id="FNanchor_28_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_231" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>From quite different motives Southern men defended this
section. For instance, Dr. David Ramsay, a South Carolina
member of the Convention, wrote in his "Address": "It is
farther objected, that they have stipulated for a right to prohibit
the importation of negroes after 21 years. On this subject
observe, as they are bound to protect us from domestic violence,
they think we ought not to increase our exposure to
that evil, by an unlimited importation of slaves. Though Congress
may forbid the importation of negroes after 21 years, it
does not follow that they will. On the other hand, it is probable
that they will not. The more rice we make, the more
business will be for their shipping; their interest will therefore
coincide with ours. Besides, we have other sources of supply&mdash;the
importation of the ensuing 20 years, added to the
natural increase of those we already have, and the influx from
our northern neighbours who are desirous of getting rid of
their slaves, will afford a sufficient number for cultivating all
the lands in this state."<a name="FNanchor_29_232" id="FNanchor_29_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_232" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Finally, <i>The Federalist</i>, No. 41, written by James Madison,
commented as follows: "It were doubtless to be wished, that
the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not
been postponed until the year 1808, or rather, that it had been
suffered to have immediate operation. But it is not difficult to
account, either for this restriction on the General Government,
or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed.
It ought to be considered as a great point gained in
favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate
forever, within these States, a traffic which has so long
and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that
within that period, it will receive a considerable discouragement
from the Federal Government, and may be totally abolished,
by a concurrence of the few States which continue the
unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been
<!-- Page 70 --><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum">70</span>given by so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it
be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before
them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their
European brethren!</p>

<p>"Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an
objection against the Constitution, by representing it on one
side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on
another, as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial
emigrations from Europe to America. I mention these misconstructions,
not with a view to give them an answer, for
they deserve none; but as specimens of the manner and spirit,
in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition
to the proposed Government."<a name="FNanchor_30_233" id="FNanchor_30_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_233" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>


<p>38. <b>Attitude of the State Conventions.</b> The records of the
proceedings in the various State conventions are exceedingly
meagre. In nearly all of the few States where records exist
there is found some opposition to the slave-trade clause. The
opposition was seldom very pronounced or bitter; it rather
took the form of regret, on the one hand that the Convention
went so far, and on the other hand that it did not go farther.
Probably, however, the Constitution was never in danger of
rejection on account of this clause.</p>

<p>Extracts from a few of the speeches, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, in various
States will best illustrate the character of the arguments. In
reply to some objections expressed in the Pennsylvania convention,
Wilson said, December 3, 1787: "I consider this as
laying the foundation for banishing slavery out of this country;
and though the period is more distant than I could wish,
yet it will produce the same kind, gradual change, which was
pursued in Pennsylvania."<a name="FNanchor_31_234" id="FNanchor_31_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_234" class="fnanchor">31</a> Robert Barnwell declared in the
South Carolina convention, January 17, 1788, that this clause
"particularly pleased" him. "Congress," he said, "has guarantied
this right for that space of time, and at its expiration may
continue it as long as they please. This question then arises&mdash;What
will their interest lead them to do? The Eastern States,
as the honorable gentleman says, will become the carriers of
America. It will, therefore, certainly be their interest to <!-- Page 71 --><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum">71</span>encourage
exportation to as great an extent as possible; and if
the quantum of our products will be diminished by the prohibition
of negroes, I appeal to the belief of every man,
whether he thinks those very carriers will themselves dam up
the sources from whence their profit is derived. To think so is
so contradictory to the general conduct of mankind, that I am
of opinion, that, without we ourselves put a stop to them, the
traffic for negroes will continue forever."<a name="FNanchor_32_235" id="FNanchor_32_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_235" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>In Massachusetts, January 30, 1788, General Heath said:
"The gentlemen who have spoken have carried the matter
rather too far on both sides. I apprehend that it is not in our
power to do anything for or against those who are in slavery
in the southern States.... Two questions naturally arise, if
we ratify the Constitution: Shall we do anything by our act
to hold the blacks in slavery? or shall we become partakers of
other men's sins? I think neither of them. Each State is sovereign
and independent to a certain degree, and they have a
right, and will regulate their own internal affairs, as to themselves
appears proper."<a name="FNanchor_33_236" id="FNanchor_33_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_236" class="fnanchor">33</a> Iredell said, in the North Carolina
convention, July 26, 1788: "When the entire abolition of slavery
takes place, it will be an event which must be pleasing to
every generous mind, and every friend of human nature....
But as it is, this government is nobly distinguished above
others by that very provision."<a name="FNanchor_34_237" id="FNanchor_34_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_237" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Of the arguments against the clause, two made in the Massachusetts
convention are typical. The Rev. Mr. Neal said,
January 25, 1788, that "unless his objection [to this clause] was
removed, he could not put his hand to the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_35_238" id="FNanchor_35_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_238" class="fnanchor">35</a>
General Thompson exclaimed, "Shall it be said, that after we
have established our own independence and freedom, we
make slaves of others?"<a name="FNanchor_36_239" id="FNanchor_36_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_239" class="fnanchor">36</a> Mason, in the Virginia convention,
June 15, 1788, said: "As much as I value a union of all the
states, I would not admit the Southern States into the Union
unless they agree to the discontinuance of this disgraceful
trade.... Yet they have not secured us the property of the
<!-- Page 72 --><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">72</span>slaves we have already. So that 'they have done what they
ought not to have done, and have left undone what they
ought to have done.'"<a name="FNanchor_37_240" id="FNanchor_37_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_240" class="fnanchor">37</a> Joshua Atherton, who led the opposition
in the New Hampshire convention, said: "The idea that
strikes those who are opposed to this clause so disagreeably
and so forcibly is,&mdash;hereby it is conceived (if we ratify the
Constitution) that we become <i>consenters to</i> and <i>partakers in</i>
the sin and guilt of this abominable traffic, at least for a certain
period, without any positive stipulation that it shall even
then be brought to an end."<a name="FNanchor_38_241" id="FNanchor_38_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_241" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>In the South Carolina convention Lowndes, January 16,
1788, attacked the slave-trade clause. "Negroes," said he,
"were our wealth, our only natural resource; yet behold how
our kind friends in the north were determined soon to tie up
our hands, and drain us of what we had! The Eastern States
drew their means of subsistence, in a great measure, from
their shipping; and, on that head, they had been particularly
careful not to allow of any burdens.... Why, then, call this
a reciprocal bargain, which took all from one party, to bestow
it on the other!"<a name="FNanchor_39_242" id="FNanchor_39_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_242" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>In spite of this discussion in the different States, only one
State, Rhode Island, went so far as to propose an amendment
directing Congress to "promote and establish such laws and
regulations as may effectually prevent the importation of
slaves of every description, into the United States."<a name="FNanchor_40_243" id="FNanchor_40_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_243" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>


<p>39. <b>Acceptance of the Policy.</b> As in the Federal Convention,
so in the State conventions, it is noticeable that the compromise
was accepted by the various States from widely
different motives.<a name="FNanchor_41_244" id="FNanchor_41_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_244" class="fnanchor">41</a> Nevertheless, these motives were not fixed
and unchangeable, and there was still discernible a certain underlying
<!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum">73</span>agreement in the dislike of slavery. One cannot help
thinking that if the devastation of the late war had not left an
extraordinary demand for slaves in the South,&mdash;if, for instance,
there had been in 1787 the same plethora in the slave-market
as in 1774,&mdash;the future history of the country would
have been far different. As it was, the twenty-one years of
<i>laissez-faire</i> were confirmed by the States, and the nation entered
upon the constitutional period with the slave-trade legal
in three States,<a name="FNanchor_42_245" id="FNanchor_42_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_245" class="fnanchor">42</a> and with a feeling of quiescence toward it in
the rest of the Union.</p>

<p>40. <b>Influence of the Haytian Revolution.</b> The r&ocirc;le which
the great Negro Toussaint, called L'Ouverture, played in the
history of the United States has seldom been fully appreciated.
Representing the age of revolution in America, he rose
to leadership through a bloody terror, which contrived a Negro
"problem" for the Western Hemisphere, intensified and
defined the anti-slavery movement, became one of the causes,
and probably the prime one, which led Napoleon to sell Louisiana
for a song, and finally, through the interworking of all
these effects, rendered more certain the final prohibition of
the slave-trade by the United States in 1807.</p>

<p>From the time of the reorganization of the Pennsylvania
Abolition Society, in 1787, anti-slavery sentiment became active.
New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland,
and Virginia had strong organizations, and a national
convention was held in 1794. The terrible upheaval in the
West Indies, beginning in 1791, furnished this rising movement
with an irresistible argument. A wave of horror and fear
swept over the South, which even the powerful slave-traders
of Georgia did not dare withstand; the Middle States saw
their worst dreams realized, and the mercenary trade interests
<!-- Page 75 --><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum">75</span>of the East lost control of the New England conscience.</p>


<p>41. <b>Legislation of the Southern States.</b> In a few years the
growing sentiment had crystallized into legislation. The
Southern States took immediate measures to close their ports,
first against West India Negroes, finally against all slaves.
Georgia, who had had legal slavery only from 1755, and had
since passed no restrictive legislation, felt compelled in 1793[1]
to stop the entry of free Negroes, and in 1798<a name="FNanchor_2_247" id="FNanchor_2_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_247" class="fnanchor">2</a> to prohibit,
under heavy penalties, the importation of all slaves. This provision
was placed in the Constitution of the State, and, although
miserably enforced, was never repealed.</p>

<p>South Carolina was the first Southern State in which the
exigencies of a great staple crop rendered the rapid consumption
of slaves more profitable than their proper maintenance.
Alternating, therefore, between a plethora and a dearth of
Negroes, she prohibited the slave-trade only for short periods.
In 1788<a name="FNanchor_3_248" id="FNanchor_3_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_248" class="fnanchor">3</a> she had forbidden the trade for five years, and
in 1792,<a name="FNanchor_4_249" id="FNanchor_4_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_249" class="fnanchor">4</a> being peculiarly exposed to the West Indian insurrection,
she quickly found it "inexpedient" to allow Negroes
"from Africa, the West India Islands, or other place beyond
sea" to enter for two years. This act continued to be extended,
although with lessening penalties, until 1803.<a name="FNanchor_5_250" id="FNanchor_5_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_250" class="fnanchor">5</a> The home demand
in view of the probable stoppage of the trade in 1808,
the speculative chances of the new Louisiana Territory trade,
and the large already existing illicit traffic combined in that
year to cause the passage of an act, December 17, reopening
the African slave-trade, although still carefully excluding
"West India" Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_6_251" id="FNanchor_6_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_251" class="fnanchor">6</a> This action profoundly stirred the
Union, aroused anti-slavery sentiment, led to a concerted<!-- Page 76 --><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">76</span>
movement for a constitutional amendment, and, failing in
this, to an irresistible demand for a national prohibitory act
at the earliest constitutional moment.</p>

<p>North Carolina had repealed her prohibitory duty act in
1790,<a name="FNanchor_7_252" id="FNanchor_7_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_252" class="fnanchor">7</a> but in 1794 she passed an "Act to prevent further
importation and bringing of slaves," etc.<a name="FNanchor_8_253" id="FNanchor_8_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_253" class="fnanchor">8</a> Even the body-servants
of West India immigrants and, naturally, all free
Negroes, were eventually prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_9_254" id="FNanchor_9_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_254" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>


<p>42. <b>Legislation of the Border States.</b> The Border States,
Virginia and Maryland, strengthened their non-importation
laws, Virginia freeing illegally imported Negroes,<a name="FNanchor_10_255" id="FNanchor_10_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_255" class="fnanchor">10</a> and Maryland
prohibiting even the interstate trade.<a name="FNanchor_11_256" id="FNanchor_11_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_256" class="fnanchor">11</a> The Middle States
took action chiefly in the final abolition of slavery within their
borders, and the prevention of the fitting out of slaving vessels
in their ports. Delaware declared, in her Act of 1789, that
"it is inconsistent with that spirit of general liberty which pervades
the constitution of this state, that vessels should be fitted
out, or equipped, in any of the ports thereof, for the
purpose of receiving and transporting the natives of Africa to
places where they are held in slavery,"<a name="FNanchor_12_257" id="FNanchor_12_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_257" class="fnanchor">12</a> and forbade such a
practice under penalty of &pound;500 for each person so engaged.
The Pennsylvania Act of 1788<a name="FNanchor_13_258" id="FNanchor_13_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_258" class="fnanchor">13</a> had similar provisions, with a
penalty of &pound;1000; and New Jersey followed with an act in
1798.<a name="FNanchor_14_259" id="FNanchor_14_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_259" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>


<p>43. <b>Legislation of the Eastern States.</b> In the Eastern
States, where slavery as an institution was already nearly defunct,
action was aimed toward stopping the notorious participation
of citizens in the slave-trade outside the State. The
prime movers were the Rhode Island Quakers. Having early
<!-- Page 77 --><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">77</span>secured a law against the traffic in their own State, they
turned their attention to others. Through their remonstrances
Connecticut, in 1788,<a name="FNanchor_15_260" id="FNanchor_15_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_260" class="fnanchor">15</a> prohibited participation in the trade by
a fine of &pound;500 on the vessel, &pound;50 on each slave, and loss of
insurance; this act was strengthened in 1792,<a name="FNanchor_16_261" id="FNanchor_16_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_261" class="fnanchor">16</a> the year after
the Haytian revolt. Massachusetts, after many fruitless attempts,
finally took advantage of an unusually bold case of
kidnapping, and passed a similar act in 1788.<a name="FNanchor_17_262" id="FNanchor_17_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_262" class="fnanchor">17</a> "This," says
Belknap, "was the utmost which could be done by our legislatures;
we still have to regret the impossibility of making a
law <i>here</i>, which shall restrain our citizens from carrying on
this trade <i>in foreign bottoms</i>, and from committing the crimes
which this act prohibits, <i>in foreign countries</i>, as it is said some
of them have done since the enacting of these laws."<a name="FNanchor_18_263" id="FNanchor_18_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_263" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Thus it is seen how, spurred by the tragedy in the West
Indies, the United States succeeded by State action in prohibiting
the slave-trade from 1798 to 1803, in furthering the cause
of abolition, and in preventing the fitting out of slave-trade
expeditions in United States ports. The country had good
cause to congratulate itself. The national government hastened
to supplement State action as far as possible, and the
prophecies of the more sanguine Revolutionary fathers
seemed about to be realized, when the ill-considered act of
South Carolina showed the weakness of the constitutional
compromise.</p>


<p>44. <b>First Debate in Congress, 1789.</b> The attention of the
national government was early directed to slavery and the
trade by the rise, in the first Congress, of the question of
taxing slaves imported. During the debate on the duty bill
introduced by Clymer's committee, Parker of Virginia
moved, May 13, 1789, to lay a tax of ten dollars <i>per capita</i> on
slaves imported. He plainly stated that the tax was designed
to check the trade, and that he was "sorry that the Constitution
prevented Congress from prohibiting the importation
altogether." The proposal was evidently unwelcome, and
caused an extended debate.<a name="FNanchor_19_264" id="FNanchor_19_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_264" class="fnanchor">19</a> Smith of South Carolina wanted
<!-- Page 78 --><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum">78</span>to postpone a matter so "big with the most serious consequences
to the State he represented." Roger Sherman of Connecticut
"could not reconcile himself to the insertion of
human beings as an article of duty, among goods, wares, and
merchandise." Jackson of Georgia argued against any restriction,
and thought such States as Virginia "ought to let their
neighbors get supplied, before they imposed such a burden
upon the importation." Tucker of South Carolina declared it
"unfair to bring in such an important subject at a time when
debate was almost precluded," and denied the right of Congress
to "consider whether the importation of slaves is proper
or not."</p>

<p>Mr. Parker was evidently somewhat abashed by this onslaught
of friend and foe, but he "had ventured to introduce
the subject after full deliberation, and did not like to withdraw
it." He desired Congress, "if possible," to "wipe off the
stigma under which America labored." This brought Jackson
of Georgia again to his feet. He believed, in spite of the "fashion
of the day," that the Negroes were better off as slaves
than as freedmen, and that, as the tax was partial, "it would
be the most odious tax Congress could impose." Such sentiments
were a distinct advance in pro-slavery doctrine, and
called for a protest from Madison of Virginia. He thought
the discussion proper, denied the partiality of the tax, and
declared that, according to the spirit of the Constitution and
his own desire, it was to be hoped "that, by expressing a national
disapprobation of this trade, we may destroy it, and
save ourselves from reproaches, and our posterity the imbecility
ever attendant on a country filled with slaves." Finally, to
Burke of South Carolina, who thought "the gentlemen were
contending for nothing," Madison sharply rejoined, "If we
contend for nothing, the gentlemen who are opposed to us
do not contend for a great deal."</p>

<p>It now became clear that Congress had been whirled into a
discussion of too delicate and lengthy a nature to allow its
further prolongation. Compromising councils prevailed; and
it was agreed that the present proposition should be withdrawn
and a separate bill brought in. This bill was, however,<!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">79</span>
at the next session dexterously postponed "until the next session
of Congress."<a name="FNanchor_20_265" id="FNanchor_20_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_265" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>


<p>45. <b>Second Debate in Congress, 1790.</b> It is doubtful if
Congress of its own initiative would soon have resurrected
the matter, had not a new anti-slavery weapon appeared in
the shape of urgent petitions from abolition societies. The
first petition, presented February 11, 1790,<a name="FNanchor_21_266" id="FNanchor_21_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_266" class="fnanchor">21</a> was from the same
interstate Yearly Meeting of Friends which had formerly petitioned
the Confederation Congress.<a name="FNanchor_22_267" id="FNanchor_22_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_267" class="fnanchor">22</a> They urged Congress
to inquire "whether, notwithstanding such seeming impediments,
it be not in reality within your power to exercise justice
and mercy, which, if adhered to, we cannot doubt, must
produce the abolition of the slave trade," etc. Another Quaker
petition from New York was also presented,<a name="FNanchor_23_268" id="FNanchor_23_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_268" class="fnanchor">23</a> and both were
about to be referred, when Smith of South Carolina objected,
and precipitated a sharp debate.<a name="FNanchor_24_269" id="FNanchor_24_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_269" class="fnanchor">24</a> This debate had a distinctly
different tone from that of the preceding one, and represents
another step in pro-slavery doctrine. The key-note of these
utterances was struck by Stone of Maryland, who "feared that
if Congress took any measures indicative of an intention to
interfere with the kind of property alluded to, it would sink
it in value very considerably, and might be injurious to a great
number of the citizens, particularly in the Southern States. He
thought the subject was of general concern, and that the petitioners
had no more right to interfere with it than any other
members of the community. It was an unfortunate circumstance,
that it was the disposition of religious sects to imagine
they understood the rights of human nature better than all
the world besides."</p>

<p>In vain did men like Madison disclaim all thought of unconstitutional
"interference," and express only a desire to see
"If anything is within the Federal authority to restrain such
violation of the rights of nations and of mankind, as is supposed
to be practised in some parts of the United States." A
storm of disapproval from Southern members met such sentiments.
<!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum">80</span>"The rights of the Southern States ought not to be
threatened," said Burke of South Carolina. "Any extraordinary
attention of Congress to this petition," averred Jackson
of Georgia, would put slave property "in jeopardy," and
"evince to the people a disposition towards a total emancipation."
Smith and Tucker of South Carolina declared that the
request asked for "unconstitutional" measures. Gerry of Massachusetts,
Hartley of Pennsylvania, and Lawrence of New
York rather mildly defended the petitioners; but after considerable
further debate the matter was laid on the table.</p>

<p>The very next day, however, the laid ghost walked again in
the shape of another petition from the "Pennsylvania Society
for promoting the Abolition of Slavery," signed by its venerable
president, Benjamin Franklin. This petition asked Congress
to "step to the very verge of the power vested in you
for discouraging every species of traffic in the persons of our
fellow-men."<a name="FNanchor_25_270" id="FNanchor_25_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_270" class="fnanchor">25</a> Hartley of Pennsylvania called up the memorial
of the preceding day, and it was read a second time and a
motion for commitment made. Plain words now came from
Tucker of South Carolina. "The petition," he said, "contained
an unconstitutional request." The commitment would alarm
the South. These petitions were "mischievous" attempts to
imbue the slaves with false hopes. The South would not submit
to a general emancipation without "civil war." The commitment
would "blow the trumpet of sedition in the
Southern States," echoed his colleague, Burke. The Pennsylvania
men spoke just as boldly. Scott declared the petition
constitutional, and was sorry that the Constitution did not
interdict this "most abominable" traffic. "Perhaps, in our Legislative
capacity," he said, "we can go no further than to impose
a duty of ten dollars, but I do not know how far I might
go if I was one of the Judges of the United States, and those
people were to come before me and claim their emancipation;
but I am sure I would go as far as I could." Jackson of Georgia
rejoined in true Southern spirit, boldly defending slavery
in the light of religion and history, and asking if it was "good
policy to bring forward a business at this moment likely to
light up the flame of civil discord; for the people of the
<!-- Page 81 --><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum">81</span>Southern States will resist one tyranny as soon as another.
The other parts of the Continent may bear them down by
force of arms, but they will never suffer themselves to be divested
of their property without a struggle. The gentleman
says, if he was a Federal Judge, he does not know to what
length he would go in emancipating these people; but I believe
his judgment would be of short duration in Georgia,
perhaps even the existence of such a Judge might be in danger."
Baldwin, his New-England-born colleague, urged moderation
by reciting the difficulty with which the constitutional
compromise was reached, and declaring, "the moment we go
to jostle on that ground, I fear we shall feel it tremble under
our feet." Lawrence of New York wanted to commit the memorials,
in order to see how far Congress might constitutionally
interfere. Smith of South Carolina, in a long speech, said
that his constituents entered the Union "from political, not
from moral motives," and that "we look upon this measure
as an attack upon the palladium of the property of our country."
Page of Virginia, although a slave owner, urged commitment,
and Madison again maintained the appropriateness
of the request, and suggested that "regulations might be made
in relation to the introduction of them [i.e., slaves] into the
new States to be formed out of the Western Territory." Even
conservative Gerry of Massachusetts declared, with regard to
the whole trade, that the fact that "we have a right to regulate
this business, is as clear as that we have any rights whatever."</p>

<p>Finally, by a vote of 43 to 11, the memorials were committed,
the South Carolina and Georgia delegations, Bland and
Coles of Virginia, Stone of Maryland, and Sylvester of New
York voting in the negative.<a name="FNanchor_26_271" id="FNanchor_26_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_271" class="fnanchor">26</a> A committee, consisting of Foster
of New Hampshire, Huntington of Connecticut, Gerry of
Massachusetts, Lawrence of New York, Sinnickson of New
Jersey, Hartley of Pennsylvania, and Parker of Virginia, was
charged with the matter, and reported Friday, March 5. The
absence of Southern members on this committee compelled it
to make this report a sort of official manifesto on the aims of
Northern anti-slavery politics. As such, it was sure to meet<!-- Page 82 --><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum">82</span>
with vehement opposition in the House, even though conservatively
worded. Such proved to be the fact when the
committee reported. The onslaught to "negative the whole
report" was prolonged and bitter, the debate <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> lasting
several days.<a name="FNanchor_1_246" id="FNanchor_1_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_246" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>47. <b>The Act of 1794.</b> This declaration of the powers of the
central government over the slave-trade bore early fruit in the
second Congress, in the shape of a shower of petitions from
abolition societies in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_30_275" id="FNanchor_30_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_275" class="fnanchor">30</a> In
some of these slavery was denounced as "an outrageous violation
of one of the most essential rights of human nature,"<a name="FNanchor_31_276" id="FNanchor_31_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_276" class="fnanchor">31</a><!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum">84</span>
and the slave-trade as a traffic "degrading to the rights of
man" and "repugnant to reason."<a name="FNanchor_32_277" id="FNanchor_32_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_277" class="fnanchor">32</a> Others declared the trade
"injurious to the true commercial interest of a nation,"<a name="FNanchor_33_278" id="FNanchor_33_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_278" class="fnanchor">33</a> and
asked Congress that, having taken up the matter, they do all
in their power to limit the trade. Congress was, however, determined
to avoid as long as possible so unpleasant a matter,
and, save an angry attempt to censure a Quaker petitioner,<a name="FNanchor_34_279" id="FNanchor_34_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_279" class="fnanchor">34</a>
nothing was heard of the slave-trade until the third Congress.</p>

<p>Meantime, news came from the seas southeast of Carolina
and Georgia which influenced Congress more powerfully
than humanitarian arguments had done. The wild revolt of
despised slaves, the rise of a noble black leader, and the birth
of a new nation of Negro freemen frightened the pro-slavery
advocates and armed the anti-slavery agitation. As a result, a
Quaker petition for a law against the transport traffic in slaves
was received without a murmur in 1794,<a name="FNanchor_35_280" id="FNanchor_35_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_280" class="fnanchor">35</a> and on March 22
the first national act against the slave-trade became a law.<a name="FNanchor_36_281" id="FNanchor_36_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_281" class="fnanchor">36</a> It
was designed "to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade
from the United States to any foreign place or country," or
the fitting out of slavers in the United States for that country.
The penalties for violation were forfeiture of the ship, a fine
of $1000 for each person engaged, and of $200 for each slave
transported. If the Quakers thought this a triumph of anti-slavery
sentiment, they were quickly undeceived. Congress
might willingly restrain the country from feeding West Indian
turbulence, and yet be furious at a petition like that of 1797,<a name="FNanchor_37_282" id="FNanchor_37_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_282" class="fnanchor">37</a>
calling attention to "the oppressed state of our brethren of
the African race" in this country, and to the interstate slave-trade.
"Considering the present extraordinary state of the
West India Islands and of Europe," young John Rutledge insisted
"that 'sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,' and t<!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pagenum">85</span>hat
they ought to shut their door against any thing which had a
tendency to produce the like confusion in this country." After
excited debate and some investigation by a special committee,
the petition was ordered, in both Senate and House, to be
withdrawn.</p>


<p>48. <b>The Act of 1800.</b> In the next Congress, the sixth, another
petition threw the House into paroxysms of slavery debate.
Waln of Pennsylvania presented the petition of certain
free colored men of Pennsylvania praying for a revision of the
slave-trade laws and of the fugitive-slave law, and for prospective
emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_38_283" id="FNanchor_38_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_283" class="fnanchor">38</a> Waln moved the reference of this memorial
to a committee already appointed on the revision of the
loosely drawn and poorly enforced Act of 1794.<a name="FNanchor_39_284" id="FNanchor_39_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_284" class="fnanchor">39</a> Rutledge of
South Carolina immediately arose. He opposed the motion,
saying, that these petitions were continually coming in and
stirring up discord; that it was a good thing the Negroes were
in slavery; and that already "too much of this new-fangled
French philosophy of liberty and equality" had found its way
among them. Others defended the right of petition, and declared
that none wished Congress to exceed its powers.
Brown of Rhode Island, a new figure in Congress, a man of
distinguished services and from a well-known family, boldly
set forth the commercial philosophy of his State. "We want
money," said he, "we want a navy; we ought therefore to use
the means to obtain it. We ought to go farther than has yet
been proposed, and repeal the bills in question altogether, for
why should we see Great Britain getting all the slave trade to
themselves; why may not our country be enriched by that
lucrative traffic? There would not be a slave the more sold,
but we should derive the benefits by importing from Africa
as well as that nation." Waln, in reply, contended that they
should look into "the slave trade, much of which was still
carrying on from Rhode Island, Boston and Pennsylvania."
Hill of North Carolina called the House back from this general
discussion to the petition in question, and, while willing
to remedy any existing defect in the Act of 1794, hoped the
petition would not be received. Dana of Connecticut declared
<!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum">86</span>that the paper "contained nothing but a farrago of the French
metaphysics of liberty and equality;" and that "it was likely to
produce some of the dreadful scenes of St. Domingo." The
next day Rutledge again warned the House against even discussing
the matter, as "very serious, nay, dreadful effects,
must be the inevitable consequence." He held up the most
lurid pictures of the fatuity of the French Convention in listening
to the overtures of the "three emissaries from St.
Domingo," and thus yielding "one of the finest islands in the
world" to "scenes which had never been practised since the
destruction of Carthage." "But, sir," he continued, "we have
lived to see these dreadful scenes. These horrid effects have
succeeded what was conceived once to be trifling. Most important
consequences may be the result, although gentlemen
little apprehend it. But we know the situation of things
there, although they do not, and knowing we deprecate it.
There have been emissaries amongst us in the Southern
States; they have begun their war upon us; an actual organization
has commenced; we have had them meeting in their
club rooms, and debating on that subject.... Sir, I do believe
that persons have been sent from France to feel the
pulse of this country, to know whether these [i.e., the Negroes]
are the proper engines to make use of: these people
have been talked to; they have been tampered with, and this
is going on."</p>

<p>Finally, after censuring certain parts of this Negro petition,
Congress committed the part on the slave-trade to the committee
already appointed. Meantime, the Senate sent down a
bill to amend the Act of 1794, and the House took this bill
under consideration.<a name="FNanchor_40_285" id="FNanchor_40_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_285" class="fnanchor">40</a> Prolonged debate ensued. Brown of
Rhode Island again made a most elaborate plea for throwing
open the foreign slave-trade. Negroes, he said, bettered their
condition by being enslaved, and thus it was morally wrong
and commercially indefensible to impose "a heavy fine and
imprisonment ... for carrying on a trade so advantageous;"
or, if the trade must be stopped, then equalize the matter<!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum">87</span> and
abolish slavery too. Nichols of Virginia thought that surely
the gentlemen would not advise the importation of more Negroes;
for while it "was a fact, to be sure," that they would
thus improve their condition, "would it be policy so to do?"
Bayard of Delaware said that "a more dishonorable item of
revenue" than that derived from the slave-trade "could not be
established." Rutledge opposed the new bill as defective and
impracticable: the former act, he said, was enough; the States
had stopped the trade, and in addition the United States had
sought to placate philanthropists by stopping the use of our
ships in the trade. "This was going very far indeed." New
England first began the trade, and why not let them enjoy its
profits now as well as the English? The trade could not be
stopped.</p>

<p>The bill was eventually recommitted and reported again.<a name="FNanchor_41_286" id="FNanchor_41_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_286" class="fnanchor">41</a>
"On the question for its passing, a long and warm debate
ensued," and several attempts to postpone it were made; it
finally passed, however, only Brown of Rhode Island, Dent
of Maryland, Rutledge and Huger of South Carolina, and
Dickson of North Carolina voting against it, and 67 voting
for it.<a name="FNanchor_42_287" id="FNanchor_42_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_287" class="fnanchor">42</a> This Act of May 10, 1800,<a name="FNanchor_43_288" id="FNanchor_43_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_288" class="fnanchor">43</a> greatly strengthened the
Act of 1794. The earlier act had prohibited citizens from
equipping slavers for the foreign trade; but this went so far
as to forbid them having any interest, direct or indirect, in
such voyages, or serving on board slave-ships in any capacity.
Imprisonment for two years was added to the former
fine of $2000, and United States commissioned ships were
directed to capture such slavers as prizes. The slaves though
forfeited by the owner, were not to go to the captor; and
the act omitted to say what disposition should be made of
them.</p>


<p>49. <b>The Act of 1803.</b> The Haytian revolt, having been
among the main causes of two laws, soon was the direct instigation
to a third. The frightened feeling in the South, when
freedmen from the West Indies began to arrive in various
ports, may well be imagined. On January 17, 1803, the town
of Wilmington, North Carolina, hastily memorialized Congress,
<!-- Page 88 --><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum">88</span>stating the arrival of certain freed Negroes from Guadeloupe,
and apprehending "much danger to the peace and
safety of the people of the Southern States of the Union"
from the "admission of persons of that description into the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_44_289" id="FNanchor_44_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_289" class="fnanchor">44</a> The House committee which considered this
petition hastened to agree "That the system of policy stated
in the said memorial to exist, and to be now pursued in the
French colonial government, of the West Indies, is fraught
with danger to the peace and safety of the United States. That
the fact stated to have occurred in the prosecution of that
system of policy, demands the prompt interference of the
Government of the United States, as well Legislative as Executive."<a name="FNanchor_45_290" id="FNanchor_45_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_290" class="fnanchor">45</a>
The result was a bill providing for the forfeiture of
any ship which should bring into States prohibiting the same
"any negro, mulatto, or other person of color;" the captain of
the ship was also to be punished. After some opposition<a name="FNanchor_46_291" id="FNanchor_46_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_291" class="fnanchor">46</a> the
bill became a law, February 28, 1803.<a name="FNanchor_47_292" id="FNanchor_47_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_292" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>


<p>50. <b>State of the Slave-Trade from 1789 to 1803.</b> Meantime,
in spite of the prohibitory State laws, the African slave-trade
to the United States continued to flourish. It was notorious
that New England traders carried on a large traffic.<a name="FNanchor_48_293" id="FNanchor_48_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_293" class="fnanchor">48</a>
Members stated on the floor of the House that "it was much
to be regretted that the severe and pointed statute against the
slave trade had been so little regarded. In defiance of its
forbiddance and its penalties, it was well known that citizens
and vessels of the United States were still engaged in that
traffic.... In various parts of the nation, outfits were made
for slave-voyages, without secrecy, shame, or apprehension....
Countenanced by their fellow-citizens at home,
who were as ready to buy as they themselves were to collect
and to bring to market, they approached our Southern harbors
and inlets, and clandestinely disembarked the sooty offspring
of the Eastern, upon the ill fated soil of the Western
hemisphere. In this way, it had been computed that, during
<!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">89</span>the last twelve months, twenty thousand enslaved negroes had
been transported from Guinea, and, by smuggling, added to
the plantation stock of Georgia and South Carolina. So little
respect seems to have been paid to the existing prohibitory
statute, that it may almost be considered as disregarded by
common consent."<a name="FNanchor_49_294" id="FNanchor_49_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_294" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>These voyages were generally made under the flag of a foreign
nation, and often the vessel was sold in a foreign port to
escape confiscation. South Carolina's own Congressman confessed
that although the State had prohibited the trade since
1788, she "was unable to enforce" her laws. "With navigable
rivers running into the heart of it," said he, "it was impossible,
with our means, to prevent our Eastern brethren, who,
in some parts of the Union, in defiance of the authority of
the General Government, have been engaged in this trade,
from introducing them into the country. The law was completely
evaded, and, for the last year or two [1802&ndash;3], Africans
were introduced into the country in numbers little short, I
believe, of what they would have been had the trade been a
legal one."<a name="FNanchor_50_295" id="FNanchor_50_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_295" class="fnanchor">50</a> The same tale undoubtedly might have been told
of Georgia.</p>


<p>51. <b>The South Carolina Repeal of 1803.</b> This vast and apparently
irrepressible illicit traffic was one of three causes
which led South Carolina, December 17, 1803, to throw aside
all pretence and legalize her growing slave-trade; the other
two causes were the growing certainty of total prohibition of
the traffic in 1808, and the recent purchase of Louisiana by the
United States, with its vast prospective demand for slave labor.
Such a combination of advantages, which meant fortunes
to planters and Charleston slave-merchants, could not longer
be withheld from them; the prohibition was repealed, and the
United States became again, for the first time in at least five
years, a legal slave mart. This action shocked the nation,
frightening Southern States with visions of an influx of untrained
barbarians and servile insurrections, and arousing and
intensifying the anti-slavery feeling of the North, which had
<!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">90</span>long since come to think of the trade, so far as legal enactment
went, as a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Scarcely a month after this repeal, Bard of Pennsylvania
solemnly addressed Congress on the matter. "For many reasons,"
said he, "this House must have been justly surprised
by a recent measure of one of the Southern States. The
impressions, however, which that measure gave my mind,
were deep and painful. Had I been informed that some formidable
foreign Power had invaded our country, I would not,
I ought not, be more alarmed than on hearing that South
Carolina had repealed her law prohibiting the importation of
slaves.... Our hands are tied, and we are obliged to stand
confounded, while we see the flood-gate opened, and pouring
incalculable miseries into our country."<a name="FNanchor_51_296" id="FNanchor_51_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_296" class="fnanchor">51</a> He then moved, as
the utmost legal measure, a tax of ten dollars per head on
slaves imported.</p>

<p>Debate on this proposition did not occur until February 14,
when Lowndes explained the circumstances of the repeal, and
a long controversy took place.<a name="FNanchor_52_297" id="FNanchor_52_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_297" class="fnanchor">52</a> Those in favor of the tax argued
that the trade was wrong, and that the tax would serve
as some slight check; the tax was not inequitable, for if a State
did not wish to bear it she had only to prohibit the trade; the
tax would add to the revenue, and be at the same time a
moral protest against an unjust and dangerous traffic. Against
this it was argued that if the tax furnished a revenue it would
defeat its own object, and make prohibition more difficult in
1808; it was inequitable, because it was aimed against one
State, and would fall exclusively on agriculture; it would give
national sanction to the trade; it would look "like an attempt
in the General Government to correct a State for the undisputed
exercise of its constitutional powers;" the revenue
would be inconsiderable, and the United States had nothing
to do with the moral principle; while a prohibitory tax would
be defensible, a small tax like this would be useless as a protection
and criminal as a revenue measure.</p>

<p>The whole debate hinged on the expediency of the
measure, few defending South Carolina's action.<a name="FNanchor_53_298" id="FNanchor_53_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_298" class="fnanchor">53</a> Finally, a
<!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">91</span>bill was ordered to be brought in, which was done on the 17th.<a name="FNanchor_54_299" id="FNanchor_54_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_299" class="fnanchor">54</a>
Another long debate took place, covering substantially the
same ground. It was several times hinted that if the matter
were dropped South Carolina might again prohibit the trade.
This, and the vehement opposition, at last resulted in the
postponement of the bill, and it was not heard from again
during the session.</p>


<p>52. <b>The Louisiana Slave-Trade, 1803&ndash;1805.</b> About this
time the cession of Louisiana brought before Congress the
question of the status of slavery and the slave-trade in the
Territories. Twice or thrice before had the subject called for
attention. The first time was in the Congress of the Confederation,
when, by the Ordinance of 1787,<a name="FNanchor_55_300" id="FNanchor_55_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_300" class="fnanchor">55</a> both slavery and
the slave-trade were excluded from the Northwest Territory.
In 1790 Congress had accepted the cession of North Carolina
back lands on the express condition that slavery there
be undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_56_301" id="FNanchor_56_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_301" class="fnanchor">56</a> Nothing had been said as to slavery in the
South Carolina cession (1787),<a name="FNanchor_57_302" id="FNanchor_57_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_302" class="fnanchor">57</a> but it was tacitly understood
that the provision of the Northwest Ordinance would not
be applied. In 1798 the bill introduced for the cession of
Mississippi contained a specific declaration that the anti-slavery
clause of 1787 should not be included.<a name="FNanchor_58_303" id="FNanchor_58_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_303" class="fnanchor">58</a> The bill passed
the Senate, but caused long and excited debate in the
House.<a name="FNanchor_59_304" id="FNanchor_59_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_304" class="fnanchor">59</a> It was argued, on the one hand, that the case in
Mississippi was different from that in the Northwest
Territory, because slavery was a legal institution in all the
surrounding country, and to prohibit the institution was
virtually to prohibit the settling of the country. On the
other hand, Gallatin declared that if this amendment should
not obtain, "he knew not how slaves could be prevented
<!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">92</span>from being introduced by way of New Orleans, by persons
who are not citizens of the United States." It was moved to
strike out the excepting clause; but the motion received
only twelve votes,&mdash;an apparent indication that Congress
either did not appreciate the great precedent it was establishing,
or was reprehensibly careless. Harper of South Carolina
then succeeded in building up the Charleston slave-trade
interest by a section forbidding the slave traffic from
"without the limits of the United States." Thatcher moved
to strike out the last clause of this amendment, and thus to
prohibit the interstate trade, but he failed to get a second.<a name="FNanchor_60_305" id="FNanchor_60_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_305" class="fnanchor">60</a>
Thus the act passed, punishing the introduction of slaves
from without the country by a fine of $300 for each slave,
and freeing the slave.<a name="FNanchor_61_306" id="FNanchor_61_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_306" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>In 1804 President Jefferson communicated papers to Congress
on the status of slavery and the slave-trade in Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_62_307" id="FNanchor_62_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_307" class="fnanchor">62</a>
The Spanish had allowed the traffic by edict in 1793,
France had not stopped it, and Governor Claiborne had refrained
from interference. A bill erecting a territorial government
was already pending.<a name="FNanchor_63_308" id="FNanchor_63_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_308" class="fnanchor">63</a> The Northern "District of
Louisiana" was placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory,
and was made subject to the provisions of the Ordinance
of 1787. Various attempts were made to amend the part
of the bill referring to the Southern Territory: first, so as completely
to prohibit the slave-trade;<a name="FNanchor_64_309" id="FNanchor_64_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_309" class="fnanchor">64</a> then to compel the emancipation
at a certain age of all those imported;<a name="FNanchor_65_310" id="FNanchor_65_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_310" class="fnanchor">65</a> next, to
confine all importation to that from the States;<a name="FNanchor_66_311" id="FNanchor_66_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_311" class="fnanchor">66</a> and, finally,
to limit it further to slaves imported before South Carolina
opened her ports.<a name="FNanchor_67_312" id="FNanchor_67_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_312" class="fnanchor">67</a> The last two amendments prevailed, and
the final act also extended to the Territory the Acts of 1794
and 1803. Only slaves imported before May 1, 1798, could be
introduced, and those must be slaves of actual settlers.<a name="FNanchor_68_313" id="FNanchor_68_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_313" class="fnanchor">68</a> All
<!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pagenum">93</span>slaves illegally imported were freed.</p>

<p>This stringent act was limited to one year. The next year,
in accordance with the urgent petition of the inhabitants, a
bill was introduced against these restrictions.<a name="FNanchor_69_314" id="FNanchor_69_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_314" class="fnanchor">69</a> By dexterous
wording, this bill, which became a law March 2, 1805,<a name="FNanchor_70_315" id="FNanchor_70_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_315" class="fnanchor">70</a> swept
away all restrictions upon the slave-trade except that relating
to foreign ports, and left even this provision so ambiguous
that, later, by judicial interpretation of the law,<a name="FNanchor_71_316" id="FNanchor_71_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_316" class="fnanchor">71</a> the foreign
slave-trade was allowed, at least for a time.</p>

<p>Such a stream of slaves now poured into the new Territory
that the following year a committee on the matter was appointed
by the House.<a name="FNanchor_72_317" id="FNanchor_72_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_317" class="fnanchor">72</a> The committee reported that they
"are in possession of the fact, that African slaves, lately imported
into Charleston, have been thence conveyed into the
territory of Orleans, and, in their opinion, this practice will
be continued to a very great extent, while there is no law to
prevent it."<a name="FNanchor_73_318" id="FNanchor_73_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_318" class="fnanchor">73</a> The House ordered a bill checking this to be
prepared; and such a bill was reported, but was soon
dropped.<a name="FNanchor_74_319" id="FNanchor_74_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_319" class="fnanchor">74</a> Importations into South Carolina during this time
reached enormous proportions. Senator Smith of that State
declared from official returns that, between 1803 and 1807,
39,075 Negroes were imported into Charleston, most of<!-- Page 94 --><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">94</span>
whom went to the Territories.<a name="FNanchor_75_320" id="FNanchor_75_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_320" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>


<p>53. <b>Last Attempts at Taxation, 1805&ndash;1806.</b> So alarming
did the trade become that North Carolina passed a resolution
in December, 1804,<a name="FNanchor_76_321" id="FNanchor_76_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_321" class="fnanchor">76</a> proposing that the States give Congress
power to prohibit the trade. Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_77_322" id="FNanchor_77_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_322" class="fnanchor">77</a> Vermont,<a name="FNanchor_78_323" id="FNanchor_78_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_323" class="fnanchor">78</a> New
Hampshire,<a name="FNanchor_79_324" id="FNanchor_79_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_324" class="fnanchor">79</a> and Maryland<a name="FNanchor_80_325" id="FNanchor_80_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_325" class="fnanchor">80</a> responded; and a joint resolution
was introduced in the House, proposing as an amendment
to the Constitution "That the Congress of the United
States shall have power to prevent the further importation of
slaves into the United States and the Territories thereof."<a name="FNanchor_81_326" id="FNanchor_81_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_326" class="fnanchor">81</a>
Nothing came of this effort; but meantime the project of taxati<!-- Page 95 --><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pagenum">95</span>on
was revived. A motion to this effect, made in February,
1805, was referred to a Committee of the Whole, but was not
discussed. Early in the first session of the ninth Congress the
motion of 1805 was renewed; and although again postponed
on the assurance that South Carolina was about to stop the
trade,<a name="FNanchor_82_327" id="FNanchor_82_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_327" class="fnanchor">82</a> it finally came up for debate January 20, 1806.<a name="FNanchor_83_328" id="FNanchor_83_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_328" class="fnanchor">83</a> Then
occurred a most stubborn legislative battle, which lasted during
the whole session.<a name="FNanchor_84_329" id="FNanchor_84_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_329" class="fnanchor">84</a> Several amendments to the motion
were first introduced, so as to make it apply to all immigrants,
and again to all "persons of color." As in the former debate,
it was proposed to substitute a resolution of censure on South
Carolina. All these amendments were lost. A long debate on
the expediency of the measure followed, on the old grounds.
Early of Georgia dwelt especially on the double taxation it
would impose on Georgia; others estimated that a revenue of
one hundred thousand dollars might be derived from the tax,
a sum sufficient to replace the tax on pepper and medicines.
Angry charges and counter-charges were made,&mdash;e.g., that
Georgia, though ashamed openly to avow the trade, participated
in it as well as South Carolina. "Some recriminations
ensued between several members, on the participation of the
traders of some of the New England States in carrying on the
slave trade." Finally, January 22, by a vote of 90 to 25, a tax
bill was ordered to be brought in.<a name="FNanchor_85_330" id="FNanchor_85_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_330" class="fnanchor">85</a> One was reported on the
27th.<a name="FNanchor_86_331" id="FNanchor_86_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_331" class="fnanchor">86</a> Every sort of opposition was resorted to. On the one
hand, attempts were made to amend it so as to prohibit importation
after 1807, and to prevent importation into the Territories;
on the other hand, attempts were made to recommit
and postpone the measure. It finally got a third reading, but
was recommitted to a select committee, and disappeared until
February 14.<a name="FNanchor_87_332" id="FNanchor_87_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_332" class="fnanchor">87</a> Being then amended so as to provide for the
forfeiture of smuggled cargoes, but saying nothing as to
the disposition of the slaves, it was again relegated to a
committee, after a vote of 69 to 42 against postponement.<a name="FNanchor_88_333" id="FNanchor_88_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_333" class="fnanchor">88</a> On
<!-- Page 96 --><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">96</span>March 4 it appeared again, and a motion to reject it was lost.
Finally, in the midst of the war scare and the question of non-importation
of British goods, the bill was apparently forgotten,
and the last attempt to tax imported slaves ended, like
the others, in failure.</p>


<p>54. <b>Key-Note of the Period.</b> One of the last acts of this
period strikes again the key-note which sounded throughout
the whole of it. On February 20, 1806, after considerable opposition,
a bill to prohibit trade with San Domingo passed
the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_89_334" id="FNanchor_89_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_334" class="fnanchor">89</a> In the House it was charged by one side that the
measure was dictated by France, and by the other, that it
originated in the fear of countenancing Negro insurrection.
The bill, however, became a law, and by continuations remained
on the statute-books until 1809. Even at that distance
the nightmare of the Haytian insurrection continued to haunt
the South, and a proposal to reopen trade with the island
caused wild John Randolph to point out the "dreadful evil"
of a "direct trade betwixt the town of Charleston and the
ports of the island of St. Domingo."<a name="FNanchor_90_335" id="FNanchor_90_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_335" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Of the twenty years from 1787 to 1807 it can only be said
that they were, on the whole, a period of disappointment so
far as the suppression of the slave-trade was concerned. Fear,
interest, and philanthropy united for a time in an effort which
bade fair to suppress the trade; then the real weakness of the
constitutional compromise appeared, and the interests of the
few overcame the fears and the humanity of the many.</p>

<p>55. <b>The Act of 1807.</b> The first great goal of anti-slavery effort
in the United States had been, since the Revolution, the
suppression of the slave-trade by national law. It would
hardly be too much to say that the Haytian revolution, in
addition to its influence in the years from 1791 to 1806, was
one of the main causes that rendered the accomplishment of
this aim possible at the earliest constitutional moment. To the
great influence of the fears of the South was added the failure
of the French designs on Louisiana, of which Toussaint
L'Ouverture was the most probable cause. The cession of
Louisiana in 1803 challenged and aroused the North on the
slavery question again; put the Carolina and Georgia slave-traders
in the saddle, to the dismay of the Border States; and
brought the whole slave-trade question vividly before the
public conscience. Another scarcely less potent influence was,
naturally, the great anti-slavery movement in England, which
after a mighty struggle of eighteen years was about to gain its
first victory in the British Act of 1807.</p>

<p>President Jefferson, in his pacificatory message of December
2, 1806, said: "I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the
approach of the period at which you may interpose your
authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the
United States from all further participation in those violations
of human rights which have been so long continued on the
<!-- Page 98 --><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum">98</span>unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality,
the reputation, and the best interests of our country, have
long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass
can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the year one
thousand eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening period
is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions
which cannot be completed before that day."<a name="FNanchor_1_336" id="FNanchor_1_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_336" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>In pursuance of this recommendation, the very next day
Senator Bradley of Vermont introduced into the Senate a bill
which, after a complicated legislative history, became the Act
of March 2, 1807, prohibiting the African slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_2_337" id="FNanchor_2_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_337" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Three main questions were to be settled by this bill: first,
and most prominent, that of the disposal of illegally imported
Africans; second, that of the punishment of those concerned
in the importation; third, that of the proper limitation of the
interstate traffic by water.</p>

<p>The character of the debate on these three questions, as well
as the state of public opinion, is illustrated by the fact that forty
of the sixty pages of officially reported debates are devoted to
the first question, less than twenty to the second, and only two
to the third. A sad commentary on the previous enforcement of
State and national laws is the readiness with which it was admitted
that wholesale violations of the law would take place;
indeed, Southern men declared that no strict law against the
slave-trade could be executed in the South, and that it was only
by playing on the motives of personal interest that the trade
could be checked. The question of punishment indicated the
slowly changing moral attitude of the South toward the slave
system. Early boldly said, "A large majority of people in the
Southern States do not consider slavery as even an evil."<a name="FNanchor_3_338" id="FNanchor_3_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_338" class="fnanchor">3</a> The
South, in fact, insisted on regarding man-stealing as a minor
offence, a "misdemeanor" rather than a "crime." Finally, in the
short and sharp debate on the interstate coastwise trade, the
growing economic side of the slavery question came to
the front, the vested interests' argument was squarely put, and
the future interstate trade almost consciously provided for.</p>
<p><!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pagenum">99</span></p>
<p>From these considerations, it is doubtful as to how far it
was expected that the Act of 1807 would check the slave
traffic; at any rate, so far as the South was concerned, there
seemed to be an evident desire to limit the trade, but little
thought that this statute would definitively suppress it.</p>

<p>56. <b>The First Question: How shall illegally imported Africans
be disposed of?</b> The dozen or more propositions on
the question of the disposal of illegally imported Africans may
be divided into two chief heads, representing two radically
opposed parties: 1. That illegally imported Africans be free,
although they might be indentured for a term of years or removed
from the country. 2. That such Africans be sold as
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_4_339" id="FNanchor_4_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_339" class="fnanchor">4</a> The arguments on these two propositions, which
were many and far-reaching, may be roughly divided into
three classes, political, constitutional, and moral.</p>
<p><!-- Page 100 --><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum">100</span></p>
<p>The political argument, reduced to its lowest terms, ran
thus: those wishing to free the Negroes illegally imported declared
that to enslave them would be to perpetrate the very
evil which the law was designed to stop. "By the same law,"
they said, "we condemn the man-stealer and become the receivers
of his stolen goods. We punish the criminal, and then
step into his place, and complete the crime."<a name="FNanchor_5_340" id="FNanchor_5_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_340" class="fnanchor">5</a> They said that
the objection to free Negroes was no valid excuse; for if the
Southern people really feared this class, they would consent
to the imposing of such penalties on illicit traffic as would
stop the importation of a single slave.<a name="FNanchor_6_341" id="FNanchor_6_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_341" class="fnanchor">6</a> Moreover, "forfeiture"
and sale of the Negroes implied a property right in them
which did not exist.<a name="FNanchor_7_342" id="FNanchor_7_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_342" class="fnanchor">7</a> Waiving this technical point, and allowing
them to be "forfeited" to the government, then the government
should either immediately set them free, or, at the
most, indenture them for a term of years; otherwise, the law
would be an encouragement to violators. "It certainly will
be," said they, "if the importer can find means to evade the
penalty of the act; for there he has all the advantage of a
market enhanced by our ineffectual attempt to prohibit."<a name="FNanchor_8_343" id="FNanchor_8_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_343" class="fnanchor">8</a>
They claimed that even the indenturing of the ignorant barbarian
for life was better than slavery; and Sloan declared that
the Northern States would receive the freed Negroes willingly
rather than have them enslaved.<a name="FNanchor_9_344" id="FNanchor_9_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_344" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The argument of those who insisted that the Negroes
should be sold was tersely put by Macon: "In adopting our
measures on this subject, we must pass such a law as can be
executed."<a name="FNanchor_10_345" id="FNanchor_10_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_345" class="fnanchor">10</a> Early expanded this: "It is a principle in legislation,
as correct as any which has ever prevailed, that to give
effect to laws you must not make them repugnant to the passions
and wishes of the people among whom they are to operate.
How then, in this instance, stands the fact? Do not
gentlemen from every quarter of the Union prove, on the discussion
of every question that has ever arisen in the House,
having the most remote bearing on the giving freedom to the
<!-- Page 101 --><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">101</span>Africans in the bosom of our country, that it has excited the
deepest sensibility in the breasts of those where slavery exists?
And why is this so? It is, because those who, from experience,
know the extent of the evil, believe that the most formidable
aspect in which it can present itself, is by making these people
free among them. Yes, sir, though slavery is an evil, regretted
by every man in the country, to have among us in any considerable
quantity persons of this description, is an evil far
greater than slavery itself. Does any gentleman want proof of
this? I answer that all proof is useless; no fact can be more
notorious. With this belief on the minds of the people where
slavery exists, and where the importation will take place, if at
all, we are about to turn loose in a state of freedom all persons
brought in after the passage of this law. I ask gentlemen
to reflect and say whether such a law, opposed to the ideas,
the passions, the views, and the affections of the people of the
Southern States, can be executed? I tell them, no; it is impossible&mdash;why?
Because no man will inform&mdash;why? Because to
inform will be to lead to an evil which will be deemed greater
than the offence of which information is given, because it will
be opposed to the principle of self-preservation, and to the
love of family. No, no man will be disposed to jeopard his
life, and the lives of his countrymen. And if no one dare inform,
the whole authority of the Government cannot carry
the law into effect. The whole people will rise up against it.
Why? Because to enforce it would be to turn loose, in the
bosom of the country, firebrands that would consume
them."<a name="FNanchor_11_346" id="FNanchor_11_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_346" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>This was the more tragic form of the argument; it also had
a mercenary side, which was presented with equal emphasis.
It was repeatedly said that the only way to enforce the law
was to play off individual interests against each other. The
profit from the sale of illegally imported Negroes was declared
to be the only sufficient "inducement to give information
of their importation."<a name="FNanchor_12_347" id="FNanchor_12_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_347" class="fnanchor">12</a> "Give up the idea of forfeiture,
and I challenge the gentleman to invent fines, penalties, or
punishments of any sort, sufficient to restrain the slave
trade."<a name="FNanchor_13_348" id="FNanchor_13_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_348" class="fnanchor">13</a> If such Negroes be freed, "I tell you that slaves will
<!-- Page 102 --><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">102</span>continue to be imported as heretofore.... You cannot get
hold of the ships employed in this traffic. Besides, slaves will
be brought into Georgia from East Florida. They will be
brought into the Mississippi Territory from the bay of Mobile.
You cannot inflict any other penalty, or devise any other
adequate means of prevention, than a forfeiture of the Africans
in whose possession they may be found after importation."<a name="FNanchor_14_349" id="FNanchor_14_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_349" class="fnanchor">14</a>
Then, too, when foreigners smuggled in Negroes, "who then ... could
be operated on, but the purchasers? There was the
rub&mdash;it was their interest alone which, by being operated on,
would produce a check. Snap their purse-strings, break open
their strong box, deprive them of their slaves, and by destroying
the temptation to buy, you put an end to the trade, ... nothing
short of a forfeiture of the slave would afford an effectual
remedy."<a name="FNanchor_15_350" id="FNanchor_15_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_350" class="fnanchor">15</a> Again, it was argued that it was impossible to
prevent imported Negroes from becoming slaves, or, what was
just as bad, from being sold as vagabonds or indentured for
life.<a name="FNanchor_16_351" id="FNanchor_16_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_351" class="fnanchor">16</a> Even our own laws, it was said, recognize the title of the
African slave factor in the transported Negroes; and if the importer
have no title, why do we legislate? Why not let the
African immigrant alone to get on as he may, just as we do
the Irish immigrant?<a name="FNanchor_17_352" id="FNanchor_17_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_352" class="fnanchor">17</a> If he should be returned to Africa, his
home could not be found, and he would in all probability
be sold into slavery again.<a name="FNanchor_18_353" id="FNanchor_18_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_353" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The constitutional argument was not urged as seriously as
the foregoing; but it had a considerable place. On the one
hand, it was urged that if the Negroes were forfeited, they
were forfeited to the United States government, which could
dispose of them as it saw fit;<a name="FNanchor_19_354" id="FNanchor_19_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_354" class="fnanchor">19</a> on the other hand, it was said
that the United States, as owner, was subject to State laws,
and could not free the Negroes contrary to such laws.<a name="FNanchor_20_355" id="FNanchor_20_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_355" class="fnanchor">20</a>
Some alleged that the freeing of such Negroes struck at the
title to all slave property;<a name="FNanchor_21_356" id="FNanchor_21_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_356" class="fnanchor">21</a> others thought that, as property
<!-- Page 103 --><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>in slaves was not recognized in the Constitution, it could
not be in a statute.<a name="FNanchor_22_357" id="FNanchor_22_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_357" class="fnanchor">22</a> The question also arose as to the source
of the power of Congress over the slave-trade. Southern men
derived it from the clause on commerce, and declared that it
exceeded the power of Congress to declare Negroes imported
into a slave State, free, against the laws of that State;
that Congress could not determine what should or should
not be property in a State.<a name="FNanchor_23_358" id="FNanchor_23_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_358" class="fnanchor">23</a> Northern men replied that, according
to this principle, forfeiture and sale in Massachusetts
would be illegal; that the power of Congress over the trade
was derived from the restraining clause, as a non-existent
power could not be restrained; and that the United States
could act under her general powers as executor of the Law
of Nations.<a name="FNanchor_24_359" id="FNanchor_24_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_359" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The moral argument as to the disposal of illegally imported
Negroes was interlarded with all the others. On the one side,
it began with the "Rights of Man," and descended to a stickling
for the decent appearance of the statute-book; on the
other side, it began with the uplifting of the heathen, and
descended to a denial of the applicability of moral principles
to the question. Said Holland of North Carolina: "It is admitted
that the condition of the slaves in the Southern States
is much superior to that of those in Africa. Who, then, will
say that the trade is immoral?"<a name="FNanchor_25_360" id="FNanchor_25_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_360" class="fnanchor">25</a> But, in fact, "morality has
nothing to do with this traffic,"<a name="FNanchor_26_361" id="FNanchor_26_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_361" class="fnanchor">26</a> for, as Joseph Clay declared,
"it must appear to every man of common sense, that the question
could be considered in a commercial point of view
only."<a name="FNanchor_27_362" id="FNanchor_27_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_362" class="fnanchor">27</a> The other side declared that, "by the laws of God and
man," these captured Negroes are "entitled to their freedom
as clearly and absolutely as we are;"<a name="FNanchor_28_363" id="FNanchor_28_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_363" class="fnanchor">28</a> nevertheless, some were
willing to leave them to the tender mercies of the slave States,
so long as the statute-book was disgraced by no explicit recognition
<!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>of slavery.<a name="FNanchor_29_364" id="FNanchor_29_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_364" class="fnanchor">29</a> Such arguments brought some sharp sarcasm
on those who seemed anxious "to legislate for the honor
and glory of the statute book;"<a name="FNanchor_30_365" id="FNanchor_30_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_365" class="fnanchor">30</a> some desired "to know what
honor you will derive from a law that will be broken every
day of your lives."<a name="FNanchor_31_366" id="FNanchor_31_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_366" class="fnanchor">31</a> They would rather boldly sell the Negroes
and turn the proceeds over to charity.</p>

<p>The final settlement of the question was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Section 4</span>.... And neither the importer, nor any person or
persons claiming from or under him, shall hold any right or title
whatsoever to any negro, mulatto, or person of color, nor to the
service or labor thereof, who may be imported or brought within
the United States, or territories thereof, in violation of this law, but
the same shall remain subject to any regulations not contravening
the provisions of this act, which the Legislatures of the several States
or Territories at any time hereafter may make, for disposing of any
such negro, mulatto, or person of color."<a name="FNanchor_32_367" id="FNanchor_32_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_367" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>
</div>

<p>57. <b>The Second Question: How shall Violations be punished?</b>
The next point in importance was that of the punishment
of offenders. The half-dozen specific propositions
reduce themselves to two: 1. A violation should be considered
a crime or felony, and be punished by death; 2. A violation
should be considered a misdemeanor, and be punished by fine
and imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_33_368" id="FNanchor_33_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_368" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Advocates of the severer punishment dwelt on the enormity
of the offence. It was "one of the highest crimes man could
<!-- Page 105 --><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>commit," and "a captain of a ship engaged in this traffic was
guilty of murder."<a name="FNanchor_34_369" id="FNanchor_34_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_369" class="fnanchor">34</a> The law of God punished the crime with
death, and any one would rather be hanged than be enslaved.<a name="FNanchor_35_370" id="FNanchor_35_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_370" class="fnanchor">35</a>
It was a peculiarly deliberate crime, in which the offender
did not act in sudden passion, but had ample time for
reflection.<a name="FNanchor_36_371" id="FNanchor_36_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_371" class="fnanchor">36</a> Then, too, crimes of much less magnitude are
punished with death. Shall we punish the stealer of $50 with
death, and the man-stealer with imprisonment only?<a name="FNanchor_37_372" id="FNanchor_37_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_372" class="fnanchor">37</a> Piracy,
forgery, and fraudulent sinking of vessels are punishable with
death, "yet these are crimes only against property; whereas
the importation of slaves, a crime committed against the liberty
of man, and inferior only to murder or treason, is accounted
nothing but a misdemeanor."<a name="FNanchor_38_373" id="FNanchor_38_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_373" class="fnanchor">38</a> Here, indeed, lies the
remedy for the evil of freeing illegally imported Negroes,&mdash;in
making the penalty so severe that none will be brought in;
if the South is sincere, "they will unite to a man to execute
the law."<a name="FNanchor_39_374" id="FNanchor_39_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_374" class="fnanchor">39</a> To free such Negroes is dangerous; to enslave
them, wrong; to return them, impracticable; to indenture
them, difficult,&mdash;therefore, by a death penalty, keep them
from being imported.<a name="FNanchor_40_375" id="FNanchor_40_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_375" class="fnanchor">40</a> Here the East had a chance to throw
back the taunts of the South, by urging the South to unite
with them in hanging the New England slave-traders, assuring
the South that "so far from charging their Southern
brethren with cruelty or severity in hanging them, they would
acknowledge the favor with gratitude."<a name="FNanchor_41_376" id="FNanchor_41_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_376" class="fnanchor">41</a> Finally, if the Southerners
would refuse to execute so severe a law because they
did not consider the offence great, they would probably refuse
to execute any law at all for the same reason.<a name="FNanchor_42_377" id="FNanchor_42_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_377" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The opposition answered that the death penalty was more
than proportionate to the crime, and therefore "immoral."<a name="FNanchor_43_378" id="FNanchor_43_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_378" class="fnanchor">43</a> "I
<!-- Page 106 --><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>cannot believe," said Stanton of Rhode Island, "that a man
ought to be hung for only stealing a negro."<a name="FNanchor_44_379" id="FNanchor_44_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_379" class="fnanchor">44</a> It was argued
that the trade was after all but a "transfer from one master to
another;"<a name="FNanchor_45_380" id="FNanchor_45_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_380" class="fnanchor">45</a> that slavery was worse than the slave-trade, and
the South did not consider slavery a crime: how could it then
punish the trade so severely and not reflect on the institution?<a name="FNanchor_46_381" id="FNanchor_46_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_381" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Severity, it was said, was also inexpedient: severity often
increases crime; if the punishment is too great, people
will sympathize with offenders and will not inform against
them. Said Mr. Mosely: "When the penalty is excessive or
disproportioned to the offence, it will naturally create a repugnance
to the law, and render its execution odious."<a name="FNanchor_47_382" id="FNanchor_47_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_382" class="fnanchor">47</a>
John Randolph argued against even fine and imprisonment,
"on the ground that such an excessive penalty could not,
in such case, be constitutionally imposed by a Government
possessed of the limited powers of the Government of the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_48_383" id="FNanchor_48_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_383" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The bill as passed punished infractions as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>For equipping a slaver, a fine of $20,000 and forfeiture of the
ship.</p>

<p>For transporting Negroes, a fine of $5000 and forfeiture of the
ship and Negroes.</p>

<p>For transporting and selling Negroes, a fine of $1000 to $10,000,
imprisonment from 5 to 10 years, and forfeiture of the ship and
Negroes.</p>

<p>For knowingly buying illegally imported Negroes, a fine of $800
for each Negro, and forfeiture.</p>
</div>

<p>58. <b>The Third Question: How shall the Interstate
Coastwise Slave-Trade be protected?</b> The first proposition
was to prohibit the coastwise slave-trade altogether,<a name="FNanchor_49_384" id="FNanchor_49_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_384" class="fnanchor">49</a> but an
amendment reported to the House allowed it "in any vessel
<!-- Page 107 --><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">107</span>or species of craft whatever." It is probable that the first
proposition would have prevailed, had it not been for the
vehement opposition of Randolph and Early.<a name="FNanchor_50_385" id="FNanchor_50_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_385" class="fnanchor">50</a> They probably
foresaw the value which Virginia would derive from this
trade in the future, and consequently Randolph violently declared
that if the amendment did not prevail, "the Southern
people would set the law at defiance. He would begin the
example." He maintained that by the first proposition "the
proprietor of sacred and chartered rights is prevented the
Constitutional use of his property."<a name="FNanchor_51_386" id="FNanchor_51_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_386" class="fnanchor">51</a> The Conference Committee
finally arranged a compromise, forbidding the coastwise
trade for purposes of sale in vessels under forty tons.<a name="FNanchor_52_387" id="FNanchor_52_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_387" class="fnanchor">52</a>
This did not suit Early, who declared that the law with this
provision "would not prevent the introduction of a single
slave."<a name="FNanchor_53_388" id="FNanchor_53_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_388" class="fnanchor">53</a> Randolph, too, would "rather lose the bill, he had
rather lose all the bills of the session, he had rather lose
every bill passed since the establishment of the Government,
than agree to the provision contained in this slave bill."<a name="FNanchor_54_389" id="FNanchor_54_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_389" class="fnanchor">54</a> He
predicted the severance of the slave and the free States, if
disunion should ever come. Congress was, however, weary
with the dragging of the bill, and it passed both Houses
with the compromise provision. Randolph was so dissatisfied
that he had a committee appointed the next day, and
introduced an amendatory bill. Both this bill and another
similar one, introduced at the next session, failed of consideration.<a name="FNanchor_55_390" id="FNanchor_55_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_390" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>


<p>59. <b>Legislative History of the Bill.</b><a name="FNanchor_56_391" id="FNanchor_56_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_391" class="fnanchor">56</a> On December 12,
1805, Senator Stephen R. Bradley of Vermont gave notice of
a bill to prohibit the introduction of slaves after 1808. By a
vote of 18 to 9 leave was given, and the bill read a first time
<!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">108</span>on the 17th. On the 18th, however, it was postponed until
"the first Monday in December, 1806." The presidential message
mentioning the matter, Senator Bradley, December 3,
1806, gave notice of a similar bill, which was brought in on
the 8th, and on the 9th referred to a committee consisting of
Bradley, Stone, Giles, Gaillard, and Baldwin. This bill
passed, after some consideration, January 27. It provided,
among other things, that violations of the act should be
felony, punishable with death, and forbade the interstate
coast-trade.<a name="FNanchor_57_392" id="FNanchor_57_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_392" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>Meantime, in the House, Mr. Bidwell of Massachusetts had
proposed, February 4, 1806, as an amendment to a bill taxing
slaves imported, that importation after December 31, 1807, be
prohibited, on pain of fine and imprisonment and forfeiture
of ship.<a name="FNanchor_58_393" id="FNanchor_58_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_393" class="fnanchor">58</a> This was rejected by a vote of 86 to 17. On December
3, 1806, the House, in appointing committees on the message,
"<i>Ordered</i>, That Mr. Early, Mr. Thomas M. Randolph,
Mr. John Campbell, Mr. Kenan, Mr. Cook, Mr. Kelly, and
Mr. Van Rensselaer be appointed a committee" on the slave-trade.
This committee reported a bill on the 15th, which was
considered, but finally, December 18, recommitted. It was reported
in an amended form on the 19th, and amended in
Committee of the Whole so as to make violation a misdemeanor
punishable by fine and imprisonment, instead of a
felony punishable by death.<a name="FNanchor_59_394" id="FNanchor_59_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_394" class="fnanchor">59</a> A struggle over the disposal of
the cargo then ensued. A motion by Bidwell to except the
cargo from forfeiture was lost, 77 to 39. Another motion by
Bidwell may be considered the crucial vote on the whole bill:
it was an amendment to the forfeiture clause, and read, <i>"Provided,
that no person shall be sold as a slave by virtue of this act."</i><a name="FNanchor_60_395" id="FNanchor_60_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_395" class="fnanchor">60</a>
This resulted in a tie vote, 60 to 60; but the casting vote of<!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>
the Speaker, Macon of North Carolina, defeated it. New
England voted solidly in favor of it, the Middle States
stood 4 for and 2 against it, and the six Southern States
stood solid against it. On January 8 the bill went again to a
select committee of seventeen, by a vote of 76 to 46. The
bill was reported back amended January 20, and on the 28th
the Senate bill was also presented to the House. On the
9th, 10th, and 11th of February both bills were considered in
Committee of the Whole, and the Senate bill finally replaced
the House bill, after several amendments had been
made.<a name="FNanchor_61_396" id="FNanchor_61_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_396" class="fnanchor">61</a> The bill was then passed, by a vote of 113 to 5.<a name="FNanchor_62_397" id="FNanchor_62_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_397" class="fnanchor">62</a> The
Senate agreed to the amendments, including that substituting
fine and imprisonment for the death penalty, but asked
for a conference on the provision which left the interstate
coast-trade free. The six conferees succeeded in bringing the
Houses to agree, by limiting the trade to vessels over forty
tons and requiring registry of the slaves.<a name="FNanchor_63_398" id="FNanchor_63_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_398" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>This bill received the approval of President Jefferson,
March 2, 1807, and became thus the "Act to prohibit the importation
of Slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction
of the United States, from and after the first day <!-- Page 111 --><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">111</span>of
January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and eight."<a name="FNanchor_65_400" id="FNanchor_65_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_400" class="fnanchor">65</a> The debates in the Senate were not reported.
Those in the House were prolonged and bitter, and
hinged especially on the disposal of the slaves, the punishment
of offenders, and the coast-trade. Men were continually
changing their votes, and the bill see-sawed backward and
forward, in committee and out, until the House was thoroughly
worn out. On the whole, the strong anti-slavery
men, like Bidwell and Sloan, were outgeneraled by Southerners,
like Early and Williams; and, considering the immense
moral backing of the anti-slavery party from the
Revolutionary fathers down, the bill of 1807 can hardly be
regarded as a great anti-slavery victory.</p>


<p>60. <b>Enforcement of the Act.</b> The period so confidently
looked forward to by the constitutional fathers had at last arrived;
the slave-trade was prohibited, and much oratory and
poetry were expended in celebration of the event. In the face
of this, let us see how the Act of 1807 was enforced and
what it really accomplished. It is noticeable, in the first
place, that there was no especial set of machinery provided
for the enforcement of this act. The work fell first to the
Secretary of the Treasury, as head of the customs collection.
Then, through the activity of cruisers, the Secretary of the
Navy gradually came to have oversight, and eventually the
whole matter was lodged with him, although the Departments
of State and War were more or less active on different
occasions. Later, at the advent of the Lincoln government,
the Department of the Interior was charged with the
enforcement of the slave-trade laws. It would indeed be
surprising if, amid so much uncertainty and shifting of
responsibility, the law were not poorly enforced. Poor enforcement,
moreover, in the years 1808 to 1820 meant far
more than at almost any other period; for these years were,
<!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>all over the European world, a time of stirring economic
change, and the set which forces might then take would in a
later period be unchangeable without a cataclysm. Perhaps
from 1808 to 1814, in the midst of agitation and war, there
was some excuse for carelessness. From 1814 on, however, no
such palliation existed, and the law was probably enforced as
the people who made it wished it enforced.</p>

<p>Most of the Southern States rather tardily passed the necessary
supplementary acts disposing of illegally imported Africans.
A few appear not to have passed any. Some of these
laws, like the Alabama-Mississippi Territory Act of 1815,<a name="FNanchor_66_401" id="FNanchor_66_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_401" class="fnanchor">66</a> directed
such Negroes to be "sold by the proper officer of the
court, to the highest bidder, at public auction, for ready
money." One-half the proceeds went to the informer or to
the collector of customs, the other half to the public treasury.
Other acts, like that of North Carolina in 1816,<a name="FNanchor_67_402" id="FNanchor_67_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_402" class="fnanchor">67</a> directed the
Negroes to "be sold and disposed of for the use of the state."
One-fifth of the proceeds went to the informer. The Georgia
Act of 1817<a name="FNanchor_68_403" id="FNanchor_68_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_403" class="fnanchor">68</a> directed that the slaves be either sold or given to
the Colonization Society for transportation, providing the society
reimburse the State for all expense incurred, and pay for
the transportation. In this manner, machinery of somewhat
clumsy build and varying pattern was provided for the carrying
out of the national act.</p>


<p>61. <b>Evidence of the Continuance of the Trade.</b> Undoubtedly,
the Act of 1807 came very near being a dead letter. The
testimony supporting this view is voluminous. It consists of
presidential messages, reports of cabinet officers, letters of
collectors of revenue, letters of district attorneys, reports
of committees of Congress, reports of naval commanders,
statements made on the floor of Congress, the testimony of
eye-witnesses, and the complaints of home and foreign anti-slavery
societies.</p>

<p>"When I was young," writes Mr. Fowler of Connecticut,
"the slave-trade was still carried on, by Connecticut shipmasters
and Merchant adventurers, for the supply of southern
ports. This trade was carried on by the consent o<!-- Page 113 --><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">113</span>f the
Southern States, under the provisions of the Federal Constitution,
until 1808, and, after that time, clandestinely. There
was a good deal of conversation on the subject, in private
circles." Other States were said to be even more involved
than Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_69_404" id="FNanchor_69_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_404" class="fnanchor">69</a> The African Society of London estimated
that, down to 1816, fifteen of the sixty thousand
slaves annually taken from Africa were shipped by Americans.
"Notwithstanding the prohibitory act of America,
which was passed in 1807, ships bearing the American flag
continued to trade for slaves until 1809, when, in consequence
of a decision in the English prize appeal courts,
which rendered American slave ships liable to capture and
condemnation, that flag suddenly disappeared from the
coast. Its place was almost instantaneously supplied by the
Spanish flag, which, with one or two exceptions, was now
seen for the first time on the African coast, engaged in covering
the slave trade. This sudden substitution of the Spanish
for the American flag seemed to confirm what was
established in a variety of instances by more direct testimony,
that the slave trade, which now, for the first time,
assumed a Spanish dress, was in reality only the trade of
other nations in disguise."<a name="FNanchor_70_405" id="FNanchor_70_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_405" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>So notorious did the participation of Americans in the
traffic become, that President Madison informed Congress
in his message, December 5, 1810, that "it appears that
American citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in
enslaved Africans, equally in violation of the laws of humanity,
and in defiance of those of their own country. The
same just and benevolent motives which produced the interdiction
in force against this criminal conduct, will doubtless
be felt by Congress, in devising further means of
suppressing the evil."<a name="FNanchor_71_406" id="FNanchor_71_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_406" class="fnanchor">71</a> The Secretary of the Navy wrote
the same year to Charleston, South Carolina: "I hear, not
without great concern, that the law prohibiting the importation
of slaves has been violated in frequent instances,
near St. Mary's."<a name="FNanchor_72_407" id="FNanchor_72_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_407" class="fnanchor">72</a> Testimony as to violations of the law and
<!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>suggestions for improving it also came in from district
attorneys.<a name="FNanchor_73_408" id="FNanchor_73_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_408" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The method of introducing Negroes was simple. A slave
smuggler says: "After resting a few days at St. Augustine, ...
I agreed to accompany Diego on a land trip
through the United States, where a <i>kaffle</i> of negroes was to
precede us, for whose disposal the shrewd Portuguese had
already made arrangements with my uncle's consignees. I
soon learned how readily, and at what profits, the Florida
negroes were sold into the neighboring American States.
The <i>kaffle</i>, under charge of negro drivers, was to strike up
the Escambia River, and thence cross the boundary into
Georgia, where some of our wild Africans were mixed with
various squads of native blacks, and driven inland, till sold
off, singly or by couples, on the road. At this period [1812],
the United States had declared the African slave trade illegal,
and passed stringent laws to prevent the importation of
negroes; yet the Spanish possessions were thriving on this
inland exchange of negroes and mulattoes; Florida was a
sort of nursery for slave-breeders, and many American
citizens grew rich by trafficking in Guinea negroes, and
smuggling them continually, in small parties, through the
southern United States. At the time I mention, the business
was a lively one, owing to the war then going on between
the States and England, and the unsettled condition of affairs
on the border."<a name="FNanchor_74_409" id="FNanchor_74_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_409" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The Spanish flag continued to cover American slave-traders.
The rapid rise of privateering during the war was not
caused solely by patriotic motives; for many armed ships fitted
out in the United States obtained a thin Spanish disguise
at Havana, and transported thousands of slaves to Brazil and
the West Indies. Sometimes all disguise was thrown aside, and
the American flag appeared on the slave coast, as in the cases
of the "Paz,"<a name="FNanchor_75_410" id="FNanchor_75_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_410" class="fnanchor">75</a> the "Rebecca," the "Rosa"<a name="FNanchor_76_411" id="FNanchor_76_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_411" class="fnanchor">76</a> (formerly the privateer
<!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>"Commodore Perry"), the "Dorset" of Baltimore,<a name="FNanchor_77_412" id="FNanchor_77_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_412" class="fnanchor">77</a> and
the "Saucy Jack."<a name="FNanchor_78_413" id="FNanchor_78_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_413" class="fnanchor">78</a> Governor McCarthy of Sierra Leone
wrote, in 1817: "The slave trade is carried on most vigorously
by the Spaniards, Portuguese, Americans and French. I have
had it affirmed from several quarters, and do believe it to be
a fact, that there is a greater number of vessels employed in
that traffic than at any former period."<a name="FNanchor_79_414" id="FNanchor_79_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_414" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>


<p>62. <b>Apathy of the Federal Government.</b> The United
States cruisers succeeded now and then in capturing a slaver,
like the "Eugene," which was taken when within four miles
of the New Orleans bar.<a name="FNanchor_80_415" id="FNanchor_80_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_415" class="fnanchor">80</a> President Madison again, in 1816,
urged Congress to act on account of the "violations and evasions
which, it is suggested, are chargeable on unworthy citizens,
who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags, and
with foreign ports; and by collusive importations of slaves
into the United States, through adjoining ports and territories."<a name="FNanchor_81_416" id="FNanchor_81_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_416" class="fnanchor">81</a>
The executive was continually in receipt of ample evidence
of this illicit trade and of the helplessness of officers of
the law. In 1817 it was reported to the Secretary of the Navy
that most of the goods carried to Galveston were brought
into the United States; "the more valuable, and the slaves are
smuggled in through the numerous inlets to the westward,
where the people are but too much disposed to render them
every possible assistance. Several hundred slaves are now at
Galveston, and persons have gone from New-Orleans to
purchase them. Every exertion will be made to intercept them,
<!-- Page 116 --><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>but I have little hopes of success."<a name="FNanchor_82_417" id="FNanchor_82_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_417" class="fnanchor">82</a> Similar letters from naval
officers and collectors showed that a system of slave piracy
had arisen since the war, and that at Galveston there was an
establishment of organized brigands, who did not go to the
trouble of sailing to Africa for their slaves, but simply captured
slavers and sold their cargoes into the United States.
This Galveston nest had, in 1817, eleven armed vessels to prosecute
the work, and "the most shameful violations of the slave
act, as well as our revenue laws, continue to be practised."<a name="FNanchor_83_418" id="FNanchor_83_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_418" class="fnanchor">83</a>
Cargoes of as many as three hundred slaves were arriving in
Texas. All this took place under Aury, the buccaneer governor;
and when he removed to Amelia Island in 1817 with the
McGregor raid, the illicit traffic in slaves, which had been
going on there for years,<a name="FNanchor_84_419" id="FNanchor_84_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_419" class="fnanchor">84</a> took an impulse that brought it
even to the somewhat deaf ears of Collector Bullock. He reported,
May 22, 1817: "I have just received information from
a source on which I can implicitly rely, that it has already
become the practice to introduce into the state of Georgia,
across the St. Mary's River, from Amelia Island, East Florida,
Africans, who have been carried into the Port of Fernandina,
subsequent to the capture of it by the Patriot army
now in possession of it ...; were the legislature to pass an
act giving compensation in some manner to informers, it
would have a tendency in a great degree to prevent the practice;
as the thing now is, no citizen will take the trouble of
searching for and detecting the slaves. I further understand,

will be extended to the worst class of West India slaves."<a name="FNanchor_85_420" id="FNanchor_85_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_420" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the injury done by these pirates to the regular
slave-trading interests was largely instrumental in exterminating
them. Late in 1817 United States troops seized Amelia
Island, and President Monroe felicitated Congress and the
country upon escaping the "annoyance and injury" of this
illicit trade.<a name="FNanchor_86_421" id="FNanchor_86_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_421" class="fnanchor">86</a> The trade, however, seems to have continued,
as is shown by such letters as the following, written three and
a half months later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Port of Darien</span>, March 14, 1818.</p>

<p>... It is a painful duty, sir, to express to you, that I am in possession
of undoubted information, that African and West India negroes
are almost daily illicitly introduced into Georgia, for sale or
settlement, or passing through it to the territories of the United
States for similar purposes; these facts are notorious; and it is not
unusual to see such negroes in the streets of St. Mary's, and such
too, recently captured by our vessels of war, and ordered to Savannah,
were illegally bartered by hundreds in that city, <i>for</i> this bartering
or bonding (as <i>it is called</i>, but in reality <i>selling</i>,) actually took
place before any decision had [been] passed by the court respecting
them. I cannot but again express to you, sir, that these irregularities
and mocking of the laws, by men who understand them, and who,
it was presumed, would have respected them, are such, that it requires
the immediate interposition of Congress to effect a suppression
of this traffic; for, as things are, should a faithful officer of the
government apprehend such negroes, to avoid the penalties imposed
by the laws, the proprietors disclaim them, and some agent of the
executive demands a delivery of the same to him, who may employ
them as he pleases, or effect a sale by way of a bond, for the restoration
of the negroes when legally called on so to do; which bond,
it is <i>understood</i>, is to be <i>forfeited</i>, as the amount of the bond is so
much less than the value of the property.... There are many negroes
... recently introduced into this state and the Alabama territory,
and which can be apprehended. The undertaking would be
great; but to be sensible that we shall possess your approbation, and
that we are carrying the views and wishes of the government into
execution, is all we wish, and it shall be done, independent of every
personal consideration.</p>

<p>This "approbation" failed to come to the zealous collector,
and on the 5th of July he wrote that, "not being favored with
<!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>a reply," he has been obliged to deliver over to the governor's
agents ninety-one illegally imported Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_88_423" id="FNanchor_88_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_423" class="fnanchor">88</a> Reports from
other districts corroborate this testimony. The collector at
Mobile writes of strange proceedings on the part of the
courts.<a name="FNanchor_89_424" id="FNanchor_89_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_424" class="fnanchor">89</a> General D.B. Mitchell, ex-governor of Georgia and
United States Indian agent, after an investigation in 1821 by
Attorney-General Wirt, was found "guilty of having prostituted
his power, as agent for Indian affairs at the Creek
agency, to the purpose of aiding and assisting in a conscious
breach of the act of Congress of 1807, in prohibition of the
slave trade&mdash;and this from mercenary motives."<a name="FNanchor_90_425" id="FNanchor_90_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_425" class="fnanchor">90</a> The indefatigable
Collector Chew of New Orleans wrote to Washington
that, "to put a stop to that traffic, a naval force suitable
to those waters is indispensable," and that "vast numbers of
slaves will be introduced to an alarming extent, unless prompt
and effectual measures are adopted by the general government."<a name="FNanchor_91_426" id="FNanchor_91_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_426" class="fnanchor">91</a>
Other collectors continually reported infractions,
complaining that they could get no assistance from the
citizens,<a name="FNanchor_92_427" id="FNanchor_92_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_427" class="fnanchor">92</a> or plaintively asking the services of "one small
cutter."<a name="FNanchor_93_428" id="FNanchor_93_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_428" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Meantime, what was the response of the government to
such representations, and what efforts were made to enforce
the act? A few unsystematic and spasmodic attempts are recorded.
In 1811 some special instructions were sent out,<a name="FNanchor_94_429" id="FNanchor_94_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_429" class="fnanchor">94</a> and
the President was authorized to seize Amelia Island.<a name="FNanchor_95_430" id="FNanchor_95_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_430" class="fnanchor">95</a> Then
came the war; and as late as November 15, 1818, in spite of the
complaints of collectors, we find no revenue cutter on the
Gulf coast.<a name="FNanchor_96_431" id="FNanchor_96_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_431" class="fnanchor">96</a> During the years 1817 and 1818<a name="FNanchor_97_432" id="FNanchor_97_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_432" class="fnanchor">97</a> some cruisers
went there irregularly, but they were too large to be effective;
<!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum">119</span>and the partial suppression of the Amelia Island pirates was
all that was accomplished. On the whole, the efforts of the
government lacked plan, energy, and often sincerity. Some
captures of slavers were made;<a name="FNanchor_98_433" id="FNanchor_98_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_433" class="fnanchor">98</a> but, as the collector at Mobile
wrote, anent certain cases, "this was owing rather to accident,
than any well-timed arrangement." He adds: "from the Chandalier
Islands to the Perdido river, including the coast, and
numerous other islands, we have only a small boat, with four
men and an inspector, to oppose to the whole confederacy of
smugglers and pirates."<a name="FNanchor_99_434" id="FNanchor_99_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_434" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>To cap the climax, the government officials were so negligent
that Secretary Crawford, in 1820, confessed to Congress
that "it appears, from an examination of the records of this
office, that no particular instructions have ever been given, by
the Secretary of the Treasury, under the original or supplementary
acts prohibiting the introduction of slaves into the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_100_435" id="FNanchor_100_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_435" class="fnanchor">100</a> Beside this inactivity, the government was
criminally negligent in not prosecuting and punishing offenders
when captured. Urgent appeals for instruction from
prosecuting attorneys were too often received in official silence;
complaints as to the violation of law by State officers
went unheeded;<a name="FNanchor_101_436" id="FNanchor_101_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_436" class="fnanchor">101</a> informers were unprotected and sometimes
driven from home.<a name="FNanchor_102_437" id="FNanchor_102_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_437" class="fnanchor">102</a> Indeed, the most severe comment
on the whole period is the report, January 7, 1819, of the
Register of the Treasury, who, after the wholesale and open
violation of the Act of 1807, reported, in response to a request
from the House, "that it doth not appear, from an
examination of the records of this office, and particularly
of the accounts (to the date of their last settlement) of the
collectors of the customs, and of the several marshals of the
<!-- Page 120 --><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">120</span>United States, that any forfeitures had been incurred under
the said act."<a name="FNanchor_103_438" id="FNanchor_103_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_438" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>63. <b>Typical Cases.</b> At this date (January 7, 1819), however,
certain cases were stated to be pending, a history of which
will fitly conclude this discussion. In 1818 three American
schooners sailed from the United States to Havana; on June
2 they started back with cargoes aggregating one hundred and
seven slaves. The schooner "Constitution" was captured by
one of Andrew Jackson's officers under the guns of Fort Barancas.
The "Louisa" and "Marino" were captured by Lieutenant
McKeever of the United States Navy. The three vessels
were duly proceeded against at Mobile, and the case began
slowly to drag along. The slaves, instead of being put under
the care of the zealous marshal of the district, were placed in
the hands of three bondsmen, friends of the judge. The marshal
notified the government of this irregularity, but apparently
received no answer. In 1822 the three vessels were
condemned as forfeited, but the court "reserved" for future
order the distribution of the slaves. Nothing whatever either
then or later was done to the slave-traders themselves. The
owners of the ships promptly appealed to the Supreme Court
of the United States, and that tribunal, in 1824, condemned
the three vessels and the slaves on two of them.<a name="FNanchor_104_439" id="FNanchor_104_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_439" class="fnanchor">104</a> These slaves,
considerably reduced in number "from various causes," were
sold at auction for the benefit of the State, in spite of the Act
of 1819. Meantime, before the decision of the Supreme Court,
the judge of the Supreme Court of West Florida had awarded
to certain alleged Spanish claimants of the slaves indemnity
for nearly the whole number seized, at the price of $650 per
head, and the Secretary of the Treasury had actually paid the
claim.<a name="FNanchor_105_440" id="FNanchor_105_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_440" class="fnanchor">105</a> In 1826 Lieutenant McKeever urgently petitions Congress
for his prize-money of $4,415.15, which he has not yet<!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">121</span>
received.<a name="FNanchor_106_441" id="FNanchor_106_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_441" class="fnanchor">106</a> The "Constitution" was for some inexplicable reason
released from bond, and the whole case fades in a very
thick cloud of official mist. In 1831 Congress sought to inquire
into the final disposition of the slaves. The information given
was never printed; but as late as 1836 a certain Calvin Mickle
petitions Congress for reimbursement for the slaves sold, for
their hire, for their natural increase, for expenses incurred,
and for damages.<a name="FNanchor_107_442" id="FNanchor_107_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_442" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>


<p>64. <b>The Supplementary Acts, 1818&ndash;1820.</b> To remedy the
obvious defects of the Act of 1807 two courses were possible:
one, to minimize the crime of transportation, and, by encouraging
informers, to concentrate efforts against the buying of
smuggled slaves; the other, to make the crime of transportation
so great that no slaves would be imported. The Act of
1818 tried the first method; that of 1819, the second.<a name="FNanchor_108_443" id="FNanchor_108_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_443" class="fnanchor">108</a> The latter
was obviously the more upright and logical, and the only
method deserving thought even in 1807; but the Act of 1818
was the natural descendant of that series of compromises
which began in the Constitutional Convention, and which,
instead of postponing the settlement of critical questions to
more favorable times, rather aggravated and complicated
them.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the Act of 1818 was the Amelia Island
scandal.<a name="FNanchor_113_448" id="FNanchor_113_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_448" class="fnanchor">113</a> Committees in both Houses reported bills, but
that of the Senate finally passed. There does not appear to
<!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>have been very much debate.<a name="FNanchor_110_445" id="FNanchor_110_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_445" class="fnanchor">110</a> The sale of Africans for the
benefit of the informer and of the United States was strongly
urged "as the only means of executing the laws against the
slave trade as experience had fully demonstrated since the origin
of the prohibition."<a name="FNanchor_111_446" id="FNanchor_111_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_446" class="fnanchor">111</a> This proposition was naturally opposed
as "inconsistent with the principles of our Government,
and calculated to throw as wide open the door to the importation
of slaves as it was before the existing prohibition."<a name="FNanchor_112_447" id="FNanchor_112_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_447" class="fnanchor">112</a>
The act, which became a law April 20, 1818,<a name="FNanchor_109_444" id="FNanchor_109_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_444" class="fnanchor">109</a> was a poorly
constructed compromise, which virtually acknowledged the
failure of efforts to control the trade, and sought to remedy
defects by pitting cupidity against cupidity, informer against
thief. One-half of all forfeitures and fines were to go to
the informer, and penalties for violation were changed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>For equipping a slaver, instead of a fine of $20,000, a fine of
$1000 to $5000 and imprisonment from 3 to 7 years.</p>

<p>For transporting Negroes, instead of a fine of $5000 and forfeiture
of ship and Negroes, a fine of $1000 to $5000 and imprisonment
from 3 to 7 years.</p>

<p>For actual importation, instead of a fine of $1000 to $10,000 and
imprisonment from 5 to 10 years, a fine of $1000 to $10,000, and
<!-- Page 123 --><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">123</span>imprisonment from 3 to 7 years.</p>

<p>For knowingly buying illegally imported Negroes, instead of a fine
of $800 for each Negro and forfeiture, a fine of $1000 for each
Negro.</p>

<p>The burden of proof was laid on the defendant, to the extent
that he must prove that the slave in question had been
imported at least five years before the prosecution. The slaves
were still left to the disposal of the States.</p>

<p>This statute was, of course, a failure from the start,<a name="FNanchor_114_449" id="FNanchor_114_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_449" class="fnanchor">114</a> and
at the very next session Congress took steps to revise it. A
bill was reported in the House, January 13, 1819, but it was
not discussed till March.<a name="FNanchor_115_450" id="FNanchor_115_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_450" class="fnanchor">115</a> It finally passed, after "much debate."<a name="FNanchor_116_451" id="FNanchor_116_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_451" class="fnanchor">116</a>
The Senate dropped its own bill, and, after striking
out the provision for the death penalty, passed the bill as it
came from the House.<a name="FNanchor_117_452" id="FNanchor_117_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_452" class="fnanchor">117</a> The House acquiesced, and the bill
became a law, March 3, 1819,<a name="FNanchor_118_453" id="FNanchor_118_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_453" class="fnanchor">118</a> in the midst of the Missouri
trouble. This act directed the President to use armed
cruisers on the coasts of the United States and Africa to
suppress the slave-trade; one-half the proceeds of the
condemned ship were to go to the captors as bounty, provided
the Africans were safely lodged with a United States
marshal and the crew with the civil authorities. These provisions
were seriously marred by a proviso which Butler of
Louisiana, had inserted, with a "due regard for the interests
of the State which he represented," viz., that a captured
slaver must always be returned to the port whence she
<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">124</span>sailed.<a name="FNanchor_119_454" id="FNanchor_119_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_454" class="fnanchor">119</a> This, of course, secured decided advantages to
Southern slave-traders. The most radical provision of the act
was that which directed the President to "make such regulations
and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the
safe keeping, support, and removal beyond the limits of the
United States, of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of
colour, as may be so delivered and brought within their jurisdiction;"
and to appoint an agent in Africa to receive
such Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_120_455" id="FNanchor_120_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_455" class="fnanchor">120</a> Finally, an appropriation of $100,000 was
made to enforce the act.<a name="FNanchor_121_456" id="FNanchor_121_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_456" class="fnanchor">121</a> This act was in some measure due
to the new colonization movement; and the return of Africans
recaptured was a distinct recognition of its efforts, and
the real foundation of Liberia.</p>

<p>To render this straightforward act effective, it was necessary
to add but one measure, and that was a penalty commensurate
with the crime of slave stealing. This was accomplished
by the Act of May 15, 1820,<a name="FNanchor_122_457" id="FNanchor_122_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_457" class="fnanchor">122</a> a law which may be regarded as
the last of the Missouri Compromise measures. The act originated
from the various bills on piracy which were introduced
early in the sixteenth Congress. The House bill, in spite of
opposition, was amended so as to include slave-trading under
piracy, and passed. The Senate agreed without a division.
<!-- Page 125 --><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>This law provided that direct participation in the slave-trade
should be piracy, punishable with death.<a name="FNanchor_123_458" id="FNanchor_123_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_458" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>65. <b>Enforcement of the Supplementary Acts, 1818&ndash;1825.</b>
A somewhat more sincere and determined effort to enforce
the slave-trade laws now followed; and yet it is a significant
fact that not until Lincoln's administration did a slave-trader
suffer death for violating the laws of the United States. The
participation of Americans in the trade continued, declining
somewhat between 1825 and 1830, and then reviving, until it
reached its highest activity between 1840 and 1860. The development
of a vast internal slave-trade, and the consequent rise
in the South of vested interests strongly opposed to slave
smuggling, led to a falling off in the illicit introduction of
Negroes after 1825, until the fifties; nevertheless, smuggling
never entirely ceased, and large numbers were thus added to
the plantations of the Gulf States.</p>

<p>Monroe had various constitutional scruples as to the execution
of the Act of 1819;<a name="FNanchor_124_459" id="FNanchor_124_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_459" class="fnanchor">124</a> but, as Congress took no action,
he at last put a fair interpretation on his powers, and appointed
Samuel Bacon as an agent in Africa to form a settlement
for recaptured Africans. Gradually the agency thus
formed became merged with that of the Colonization Society
on Cape Mesurado; and from this union Liberia was finally
evolved.<a name="FNanchor_125_460" id="FNanchor_125_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_460" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Meantime, during the years 1818 to 1820, the activity of the
slave-traders was prodigious. General James Tallmadge declared
in the House, February 15, 1819: "Our laws are already
highly penal against their introduction, and yet, it is a well
known fact, that about fourteen thousand slaves have been
brought into our country this last year."<a name="FNanchor_126_461" id="FNanchor_126_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_461" class="fnanchor">126</a> In the same year
Middleton of South Carolina and Wright of Virginia estimated
illicit introduction at 13,000 and 15,000 respectively.

Judge Story, in charging a jury, took occasion to say: "We
have but too many proofs from unquestionable sources, that
it [the slave-trade] is still carried on with all the implacable
rapacity of former times. Avarice has grown more subtle in its
evasions, and watches and seizes its prey with an appetite
quickened rather than suppressed by its guilty vigils. American
citizens are steeped to their very mouths (I can hardly use
too bold a figure) in this stream of iniquity."<a name="FNanchor_128_463" id="FNanchor_128_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_463" class="fnanchor">128</a> The following
year, 1820, brought some significant statements from various
members of Congress. Said Smith of South Carolina: "Pharaoh
was, for his temerity, drowned in the Red Sea, in pursuing
them [the Israelites] contrary to God's express will; but
our Northern friends have not been afraid even of that, in
their zeal to furnish the Southern States with Africans. They
are better seamen than Pharaoh, and calculate by that means
to elude the vigilance of Heaven; which they seem to disregard,
if they can but elude the violated laws of their country."<a name="FNanchor_129_464" id="FNanchor_129_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_464" class="fnanchor">129</a>
As late as May he saw little hope of suppressing the
traffic.<a name="FNanchor_130_465" id="FNanchor_130_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_465" class="fnanchor">130</a> Sergeant of Pennsylvania declared: "It is notorious
that, in spite of the utmost vigilance that can be employed,
African negroes are clandestinely brought in and sold as
slaves."<a name="FNanchor_131_466" id="FNanchor_131_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_466" class="fnanchor">131</a> Plumer of New Hampshire stated that "of the unhappy
beings, thus in violation of all laws transported to our
shores, and thrown by force into the mass of our black population,
scarcely one in a hundred is ever detected by the officers
of the General Government, in a part of the country,
where, if we are to believe the statement of Governor Rabun,
'an officer who would perform his duty, by attempting to enforce
the law [against the slave trade] is, by many, considered
as an officious meddler, and treated with derision and contempt;' ...
I have been told by a gentleman, who has attended
particularly to this subject, that ten thousand slaves
were in one year smuggled into the United States; and that,
even for the last year, we must count the number not by
<!-- Page 128 --><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>hundreds, but by thousands."<a name="FNanchor_132_467" id="FNanchor_132_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_467" class="fnanchor">132</a> In 1821 a committee of Congress
characterized prevailing methods as those "of the grossest
fraud that could be practised to deceive the officers of
government."<a name="FNanchor_133_468" id="FNanchor_133_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_468" class="fnanchor">133</a> Another committee, in 1822, after a careful examination
of the subject, declare that they "find it impossible
to measure with precision the effect produced upon the
American branch of the slave trade by the laws above mentioned,
and the seizures under them. They are unable to state,
whether those American merchants, the American capital and
seamen which heretofore aided in this traffic, have abandoned
it altogether, or have sought shelter under the flags of other
nations." They then state the suspicious circumstance that,
with the disappearance of the American flag from the traffic,
"the trade, notwithstanding, increases annually, under the
flags of other nations." They complain of the spasmodic efforts
of the executive. They say that the first United States
cruiser arrived on the African coast in March, 1820, and remained
a "few weeks;" that since then four others had in two
years made five visits in all; but "since the middle of last November,
the commencement of the healthy season on that
coast, no vessel has been, nor, as your committee is informed,
is, under orders for that service."<a name="FNanchor_134_469" id="FNanchor_134_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_469" class="fnanchor">134</a> The United States African
agent, Ayres, reported in 1823: "I was informed by an American
officer who had been on the coast in 1820, that he had
boarded 20 American vessels in one morning, lying in the
port of Gallinas, and fitted for the reception of slaves. It is a
lamentable fact, that most of the harbours, between the Senegal
and the line, were visited by an equal number of American
vessels, and for the sole purpose of carrying away slaves.
Although for some years the coast had been occasionally
visited by our cruizers, their short stay and seldom appearance
<!-- Page 129 --><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">129</span>had made but slight impression on those traders, rendered
hardy by repetition of crime, and avaricious by excessive gain.
They were enabled by a regular system to gain intelligence of
any cruizer being on the coast."<a name="FNanchor_135_470" id="FNanchor_135_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_470" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Even such spasmodic efforts bore abundant fruit, and indicated
what vigorous measures might have accomplished.
Between May, 1818, and November, 1821, nearly six hundred
Africans were recaptured and eleven American slavers taken.<a name="FNanchor_136_471" id="FNanchor_136_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_471" class="fnanchor">136</a>
Such measures gradually changed the character of the trade,
and opened the international phase of the question. American
slavers cleared for foreign ports, there took a foreign flag and
papers, and then sailed boldly past American cruisers, although
their real character was often well known. More stringent
clearance laws and consular instructions might have
greatly reduced this practice; but nothing was ever done, and
gradually the laws became in large measure powerless to deal
with the bulk of the illicit trade. In 1820, September 16, a
British officer, in his official report, declares that, in spite of
United States laws, "American vessels, American subjects, and
American capital, are unquestionably engaged in the trade,
though under other colours and in disguise."<a name="FNanchor_137_472" id="FNanchor_137_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_472" class="fnanchor">137</a> The United
States ship "Cyane" at one time reported ten captures within
a few days, adding: "Although they are evidently owned by
Americans, they are so completely covered by Spanish papers
that it is impossible to condemn them."<a name="FNanchor_138_473" id="FNanchor_138_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_473" class="fnanchor">138</a> The governor of
Sierra Leone reported the rivers Nunez and Pongas full of
renegade European and American slave-traders;<a name="FNanchor_139_474" id="FNanchor_139_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_474" class="fnanchor">139</a> the trade
was said to be carried on "to an extent that almost staggers
belief."<a name="FNanchor_140_475" id="FNanchor_140_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_475" class="fnanchor">140</a> Down to 1824 or 1825, reports from all quarters prove
<!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>this activity in slave-trading.</p>

<p>The execution of the laws within the country exhibits grave
defects and even criminal negligence. Attorney-General Wirt
finds it necessary to assure collectors, in 1819, that "it is against
public policy to dispense with prosecutions for violation of
the law to prohibit the Slave trade."<a name="FNanchor_141_476" id="FNanchor_141_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_476" class="fnanchor">141</a> One district attorney
writes: "It appears to be almost impossible to enforce the laws
of the United States against offenders after the negroes have
been landed in the state."<a name="FNanchor_142_477" id="FNanchor_142_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_477" class="fnanchor">142</a> Again, it is asserted that "when
vessels engaged in the slave trade have been detained by the
American cruizers, and sent into the slave-holding states,
there appears at once a difficulty in securing the freedom to
these captives which the laws of the United States have decreed
for them."<a name="FNanchor_143_478" id="FNanchor_143_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_478" class="fnanchor">143</a> In some cases, one man would smuggle in
the Africans and hide them in the woods; then his partner
would "rob" him, and so all trace be lost.<a name="FNanchor_144_479" id="FNanchor_144_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_479" class="fnanchor">144</a> Perhaps 350 Africans
were officially reported as brought in contrary to law
from 1818 to 1820: the absurdity of this figure is apparent.<a name="FNanchor_145_480" id="FNanchor_145_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_480" class="fnanchor">145</a> A
circular letter to the marshals, in 1821, brought reports of only
a few well-known cases, like that of the "General Ramirez;"
the marshal of Louisiana had "no information."<a name="FNanchor_146_481" id="FNanchor_146_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_481" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>There appears to be little positive evidence of a large illicit
importation into the country for a decade after 1825. It is
hardly possible, however, considering the activity in the trade,
that slaves were not largely imported. Indeed, when we note
how the laws were continually broken in other respects, absence
of evidence of petty smuggling becomes presumptive
evidence that collusive or tacit understanding of officers and
citizens allowed the trade to some extent.<a name="FNanchor_147_482" id="FNanchor_147_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_482" class="fnanchor">147</a> Finally, it must be
noted that during all this time scarcely a man suffered for
<!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>participating in the trade, beyond the loss of the Africans and,
more rarely, of his ship. Red-handed slavers, caught in the act
and convicted, were too often, like La Coste of South Carolina,
the subjects of executive clemency.<a name="FNanchor_148_483" id="FNanchor_148_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_483" class="fnanchor">148</a> In certain cases there
were those who even had the effrontery to ask Congress to
cancel their own laws. For instance, in 1819 a Venezuelan privateer,
secretly fitted out and manned by Americans in Baltimore,
succeeded in capturing several American, Portuguese,<!-- Page 132 --><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>
and Spanish slavers, and appropriating the slaves; being
finally wrecked herself, she transferred her crew and slaves to
one of her prizes, the "Antelope," which was eventually captured
by a United States cruiser and the 280 Africans sent to
Georgia. After much litigation, the United States Supreme
Court ordered those captured from Spaniards to be surrendered,
and the others to be returned to Africa. By some mysterious
process, only 139 Africans now remained, 100 of
whom were sent to Africa. The Spanish claimants of the remaining
thirty-nine sold them to a certain Mr. Wilde, who
gave bond to transport them out of the country. Finally, in
December, 1827, there came an innocent petition to Congress
to <i>cancel this bond</i>.<a name="FNanchor_149_484" id="FNanchor_149_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_484" class="fnanchor">149</a> A bill to that effect passed and was approved,
May 2, 1828,<a name="FNanchor_150_485" id="FNanchor_150_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_485" class="fnanchor">150</a> and in consequence these Africans remained
as slaves in Georgia.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is plain that, although in the period from
1807 to 1820 Congress laid down broad lines of legislation
sufficient, save in some details, to suppress the African slave
trade to America, yet the execution of these laws was criminally
lax. Moreover, by the facility with which slavers could
disguise their identity, it was possible for them to escape even
a vigorous enforcement of our laws. This situation could
properly be met only by energetic and sincere international
co-operation. The next chapter will review efforts directed toward
this end.<a name="FNanchor_151_486" id="FNanchor_151_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_486" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

there was a bill on piracy, and a slave-trade committee reported recommending
that the slave-trade be piracy. The Senate bill and this bill were considered
in Committee of the Whole, May 11, and a bill was finally passed
declaring, among other things, the traffic piracy. In the Senate there was
"some discussion, rather on the form than the substance of these amendments,"
and "they were agreed to without a division": <i>Senate Journal</i>, 16

<p>66. <b>The Rise of the Movement against the Slave-Trade,
1788&ndash;1807.</b> At the beginning of the nineteenth century England
held 800,000 slaves in her colonies; France, 250,000;
Denmark, 27,000; Spain and Portugal, 600,000; Holland,
50,000; Sweden, 600; there were also about 2,000,000 slaves
in Brazil, and about 900,000 in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_1_487" id="FNanchor_1_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_487" class="fnanchor">1</a> This was
the powerful basis of the demand for the slave-trade; and
against the economic forces which these four and a half millions
of enforced laborers represented, the battle for freedom
had to be fought.</p>

<p>Denmark first responded to the denunciatory cries of the
eighteenth century against slavery and the slave-trade. In 1792,
by royal order, this traffic was prohibited in the Danish possessions
after 1802. The principles of the French Revolution
logically called for the extinction of the slave system by
France. This was, however, accomplished more precipitately
than the Convention anticipated; and in a whirl of enthusiasm
engendered by the appearance of the Dominican deputies,
slavery and the slave-trade were abolished in all French
colonies February 4, 1794.<a name="FNanchor_2_488" id="FNanchor_2_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_488" class="fnanchor">2</a> This abolition was short-lived; for
at the command of the First Consul slavery and the slave-trade
was restored in An X (1799).<a name="FNanchor_3_489" id="FNanchor_3_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_489" class="fnanchor">3</a> The trade was finally abo<!-- Page 134 --><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">134</span>lished
by Napoleon during the Hundred Days by a decree,
March 29, 1815, which briefly declared: "&Agrave; dater de la publication
du pr&eacute;sent D&eacute;cret, la Traite des Noirs est abolie."<a name="FNanchor_4_490" id="FNanchor_4_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_490" class="fnanchor">4</a> The
Treaty of Paris eventually confirmed this law.<a name="FNanchor_5_491" id="FNanchor_5_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_491" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>In England, the united efforts of Sharpe, Clarkson, and
Wilberforce early began to arouse public opinion by means of
agitation and pamphlet literature. May 21, 1788, Sir William
Dolben moved a bill regulating the trade, which passed in
July and was the last English measure countenancing the
traffic.<a name="FNanchor_6_492" id="FNanchor_6_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_492" class="fnanchor">6</a> The report of the Privy Council on the subject in
1789<a name="FNanchor_7_493" id="FNanchor_7_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_493" class="fnanchor">7</a> precipitated the long struggle. On motion of Pitt, in
1788, the House had resolved to take up at the next session
the question of the abolition of the trade.<a name="FNanchor_8_494" id="FNanchor_8_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_494" class="fnanchor">8</a> It was, accordingly,
called up by Wilberforce, and a remarkable parliamentary
battle ensued, which lasted continuously until 1805. The
Grenville-Fox ministry now espoused the cause. This ministry
first prohibited the trade with such colonies as England had
acquired by conquest during the Napoleonic wars; then, in
1806, they prohibited the foreign slave-trade; and finally,
March 25, 1807, enacted the total abolition of the traffic.<a name="FNanchor_9_495" id="FNanchor_9_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_495" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>


<p>67. <b>Concerted Action of the Powers, 1783&ndash;1814.</b> During
the peace negotiations between the United States and Great
Britain in 1783, it was proposed by Jay, in June, that there be
a proviso inserted as follows: "Provided that the subjects of
<!-- Page 135 --><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>his Britannic Majesty shall not have any right or claim under
the convention, to carry or import, into the said States any
slaves from any part of the world; it being the intention of
the said States entirely to prohibit the importation thereof."<a name="FNanchor_10_496" id="FNanchor_10_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_496" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Fox promptly replied: "If that be their policy, it never can be
competent to us to dispute with them their own regulations."<a name="FNanchor_11_497" id="FNanchor_11_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_497" class="fnanchor">11</a>
No mention of this was, however, made in the final
treaty, probably because it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<p>In the proposed treaty of 1806, signed at London December
31, Article 24 provided that "The high contracting parties
engage to communicate to each other, without delay, all such
laws as have been or shall be hereafter enacted by their respective
Legislatures, as also all measures which shall have
been taken for the abolition or limitation of the African slave
trade; and they further agree to use their best endeavors to
procure the co-operation of other Powers for the final and
complete abolition of a trade so repugnant to the principles
of justice and humanity."<a name="FNanchor_12_498" id="FNanchor_12_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_498" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>This marks the beginning of a long series of treaties between
England and other powers looking toward the prohibition
of the traffic by international agreement. During the
years 1810&ndash;1814 she signed treaties relating to the subject with
Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_13_499" id="FNanchor_13_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_499" class="fnanchor">13</a> May 30, 1814, an additional
article to the Treaty of Paris, between France and Great Britain,
engaged these powers to endeavor to induce the approaching
Congress at Vienna "to decree the abolition of the
Slave Trade, so that the said Trade shall cease universally, as
it shall cease definitively, under any circumstances, on the part
of the French Government, in the course of 5 years; and that
during the said period no Slave Merchant shall import or
sell Slaves, except in the Colonies of the State of which he
is a Subject."<a name="FNanchor_14_500" id="FNanchor_14_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_500" class="fnanchor">14</a> In addition to this, the next day a circular
letter was despatched by Castlereagh to Austria, Russia, and
Prussia, expressing the hope "that the Powers of Europe,<!-- Page 136 --><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>
when restoring Peace to Europe, with one common interest,
will crown this great work by interposing their benign offices
in favour of those Regions of the Globe, which yet continue
to be desolated by this unnatural and inhuman traffic."<a name="FNanchor_15_501" id="FNanchor_15_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_501" class="fnanchor">15</a>
Meantime additional treaties were secured: in 1814 by royal
decree Netherlands agreed to abolish the trade;<a name="FNanchor_16_502" id="FNanchor_16_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_502" class="fnanchor">16</a> Spain was
induced by her necessities to restrain her trade to her own
colonies, and to endeavor to prevent the fraudulent use of her
flag by foreigners;<a name="FNanchor_17_503" id="FNanchor_17_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_503" class="fnanchor">17</a> and in 1815 Portugal agreed to abolish the
slave-trade north of the equator.<a name="FNanchor_18_504" id="FNanchor_18_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_504" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>


<p>68. <b>Action of the Powers from 1814 to 1820.</b> At the Congress
of Vienna, which assembled late in 1814, Castlereagh
was indefatigable in his endeavors to secure the abolition of
the trade. France and Spain, however, refused to yield farther
than they had already done, and the other powers hesitated
to go to the lengths he recommended. Nevertheless, he secured
the institution of annual conferences on the matter, and
a declaration by the Congress strongly condemning the trade
and declaring that "the public voice in all civilized countries
was raised to demand its suppression as soon as possible," and
that, while the definitive period of termination would be left
to subsequent negotiation, the sovereigns would not consider
their work done until the trade was entirely suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_19_505" id="FNanchor_19_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_505" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>In the Treaty of Ghent, between Great Britain and the
United States, ratified February 17, 1815, Article 10, proposed
by Great Britain, declared that, "Whereas the traffic in slaves
is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice,"
the two countries agreed to use their best endeavors in abolishing
the trade.<a name="FNanchor_20_506" id="FNanchor_20_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_506" class="fnanchor">20</a> The final overthrow of Napoleon was
marked by a second declaration of the powers, who, "desiring
to give effect to the measures on which they deliberated at
the Congress of Vienna, relative to the complete and universal
<!-- Page 137 --><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>abolition of the Slave Trade, and having, each in their
respective Dominions, prohibited without restriction their
Colonies and Subjects from taking any part whatever in this
Traffic, engage to renew conjointly their efforts, with the view
of securing final success to those principles which they proclaimed
in the Declaration of the 4th February, 1815, and of
concerting, without loss of time, through their Ministers at
the Courts of London and of Paris, the most effectual measures
for the entire and definitive abolition of a Commerce so
odious, and so strongly condemned by the laws of religion
and of nature."<a name="FNanchor_21_507" id="FNanchor_21_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_507" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Treaties further restricting the trade continued to be made
by Great Britain: Spain abolished the trade north of the
equator in 1817,<a name="FNanchor_22_508" id="FNanchor_22_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_508" class="fnanchor">22</a> and promised entire abolition in 1820;
Spain, Portugal, and Holland also granted a mutual limited
Right of Search to England, and joined in establishing
mixed courts.<a name="FNanchor_23_509" id="FNanchor_23_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_509" class="fnanchor">23</a> The effort, however, to secure a general declaration
of the powers urging, if not compelling, the abolition
of the trade in 1820, as well as the attempt to secure a
qualified international Right of Visit, failed, although both
propositions were strongly urged by England at the Conference
of 1818.<a name="FNanchor_24_510" id="FNanchor_24_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_510" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>


<p>69. <b>The Struggle for an International Right of Search,
1820&ndash;1840.</b> Whatever England's motives were, it is certain
that only a limited international Right of Visit on the high
seas could suppress or greatly limit the slave-trade. Her diplomacy
was therefore henceforth directed to this end. On the
other hand, the maritime supremacy of England, so successfully<!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>asserted during the Napoleonic wars, would, in case a
Right of Search were granted, virtually make England the policeman
of the seas; and if nations like the United States had
already, under present conditions, had just cause to complain
of violations by England of their rights on the seas, might not
any extension of rights by international agreement be dangerous?
It was such considerations that for many years brought
the powers to a dead-lock in their efforts to suppress the
slave-trade.</p>

<p>At first it looked as if England might attempt, by judicial
decisions in her own courts, to seize even foreign slavers.<a name="FNanchor_25_511" id="FNanchor_25_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_511" class="fnanchor">25</a>
After the war, however, her courts disavowed such action,<a name="FNanchor_26_512" id="FNanchor_26_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_512" class="fnanchor">26</a>
and the right was sought for by treaty stipulation. Castlereagh
took early opportunity to approach the United States on the
matter, suggesting to Minister Rush, June 20, 1818, a mutual
but strictly limited Right of Search.<a name="FNanchor_27_513" id="FNanchor_27_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_513" class="fnanchor">27</a> Rush was ordered to
give him assurances of the solicitude of the United States to
suppress the traffic, but to state that the concessions asked for
appeared of a character not adaptable to our institutions. Negotiations
were then transferred to Washington; and the new
British minister, Mr. Stratford Canning, approached Adams
with full instructions in December, 1820.<a name="FNanchor_28_514" id="FNanchor_28_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_514" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Meantime, it had become clear to many in the United
States that the individual efforts of States could never suppress
or even limit the trade without systematic co-operation.
In 1817 a committee of the House had urged the opening of
negotiations looking toward such international co-operation,<a name="FNanchor_29_515" id="FNanchor_29_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_515" class="fnanchor">29</a>
and a Senate motion to the same effect had caused long debate.<a name="FNanchor_30_516" id="FNanchor_30_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_516" class="fnanchor">30</a>
In 1820 and 1821 two House committee reports, one of
which recommended the granting of a Right of Search, were
adopted by the House, but failed in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_31_517" id="FNanchor_31_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_517" class="fnanchor">31</a> Adams,
notwithstanding this, saw constitutional objections to the
<!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>
plan proposed by Canning, and wrote to him, December 30:
"A Compact, giving the power to the Naval Officers of one
Nation to search the Merchant Vessels of another for Offenders
and offences against the Laws of the latter, backed
by a further power to seize and carry into a Foreign Port,
and there subject to the decision of a Tribunal composed of
at least one half Foreigners, irresponsible to the Supreme
Corrective tribunal of this Union, and not amendable to the
controul of impeachment for official misdemeanors, was an
investment of power, over the persons, property and reputation
of the Citizens of this Country, not only unwarranted
by any delegation of Sovereign Power to the National Government,
but so adverse to the elementary principles and indispensable
securities of individual rights, ... that not
even the most unqualified approbation of the ends ...
could justify the transgression." He then suggested co-operation
of the fleets on the coast of Africa, a proposal which
was promptly accepted.<a name="FNanchor_32_518" id="FNanchor_32_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_518" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The slave-trade was again a subject of international consideration
at the Congress of Verona in 1822. Austria, France,
Great Britain, Russia, and Prussia were represented. The
English delegates declared that, although only Portugal and
Brazil allowed the trade, yet the traffic was at that moment
carried on to a greater extent than ever before. They said that
in seven months of the year 1821 no less than 21,000 slaves
were abducted, and three hundred and fifty-two vessels entered
African ports north of the equator. "It is obvious," said
they, "that this crime is committed in contravention of the
Laws of every Country of Europe, and of America, excepting
only of one, and that it requires something more than the
ordinary operation of Law to prevent it." England therefore
recommended:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- Page 140 --><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum">140</span></p>
<p>1. That each country denounce the trade as piracy, with
a view of founding upon the aggregate of such separate declarations
a general law to be incorporated in the Law of
Nations.</p>

<p>2. A withdrawing of the flags of the Powers from persons
not natives of these States, who engage in the traffic under
the flags of these States.</p>

<p>3. A refusal to admit to their domains the produce of the
colonies of States allowing the trade, a measure which would
apply to Portugal and Brazil alone.</p>

<p>These proposals were not accepted. Austria would agree to
the first two only; France refused to denounce the trade as
piracy; and Prussia was non-committal. The utmost that
could be gained was another denunciation of the trade
couched in general terms.<a name="FNanchor_33_519" id="FNanchor_33_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_519" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>


<p>70. <b>Negotiations of 1823&ndash;1825.</b> England did not, however,
lose hope of gaining some concession from the United States.
Another House committee had, in 1822, reported that the
only method of suppressing the trade was by granting a Right
of Search.<a name="FNanchor_34_520" id="FNanchor_34_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_520" class="fnanchor">34</a> The House agreed, February 28, 1823, to request
the President to enter into negotiations with the maritime
powers of Europe to denounce the slave-trade as piracy; an
amendment "that we agree to a qualified right of search" was,
however, lost.<a name="FNanchor_35_521" id="FNanchor_35_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_521" class="fnanchor">35</a> Meantime, the English minister was continually
pressing the matter upon Adams, who proposed in turn
to denounce the trade as piracy. Canning agreed to this, but
only on condition that it be piracy under the Law of Nations
and not merely by statute law. Such an agreement, he said,
would involve a Right of Search for its enforcement; he proposed
strictly to limit and define this right, to allow captured
ships to be tried in their own courts, and not to commit the
United States in any way to the question of the belligerent
Right of Search. Adams finally sent a draft of a proposed
treaty to England, and agreed to recognize the slave-traffic "as
piracy under the law of nations, namely: that, although seizable
by the officers and authorities of every nation, they
should be triable only by the tribunals of the country of the
<!-- Page 141 --><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>slave trading vessel."<a name="FNanchor_36_522" id="FNanchor_36_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_522" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>Rush presented this <i>project</i> to the government in January,
1824. England agreed to all the points insisted on by the
United States; viz., that she herself should denounce the trade
as piracy; that slavers should be tried in their own country;
that the captor should be laid under the most effective responsibility
for his conduct; and that vessels under convoy of
a ship of war of their own country should be exempt from
search. In addition, England demanded that citizens of either
country captured under the flag of a third power should be
sent home for trial, and that citizens of either country chartering
vessels of a third country should come under these
stipulations.<a name="FNanchor_37_523" id="FNanchor_37_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_523" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>This convention was laid before the Senate April 30, 1824,
but was not acted upon until May 21, when it was so
amended as to make it terminable at six months' notice. The
same day, President Monroe, "apprehending, from the delay
in the decision, that some difficulty exists," sent a special message
to the Senate, giving at length the reasons for signing
the treaty, and saying that "should this Convention be
adopted, there is every reason to believe, that it will be the
commencement of a system destined to accomplish the entire
Abolition of the Slave Trade." It was, however, a time of
great political pot-boiling, and consequently an unfortunate
occasion to ask senators to settle any great question. A systematic
attack, led by Johnson of Louisiana, was made on all
the vital provisions of the treaty: the waters of America were
excepted from its application, and those of the West Indies
barely escaped exception; the provision which, perhaps,
aimed the deadliest blow at American slave-trade interests was
likewise struck out; namely, the application of the Right of
Search to citizens chartering the vessels of a third nation.<a name="FNanchor_38_524" id="FNanchor_38_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_524" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The convention thus mutilated was not signed by England,
who demanded as the least concession the application of the
Right of Search to American waters. Meantime the United
States had invited nearly all nations to denounce the t<!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>rade as
piracy; and the President, the Secretary of the Navy, and a
House committee had urgently favored the granting of the
Right of Search. The bad faith of Congress, however, in the
matter of the Colombian treaty broke off for a time further
negotiations with England.<a name="FNanchor_39_525" id="FNanchor_39_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_525" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>


<p>71. <b>The Attitude of the United States and the State of
the Slave-Trade.</b> In 1824 the Right of Search was established
between England and Sweden, and in 1826 Brazil promised to
abolish the trade in three years.<a name="FNanchor_40_526" id="FNanchor_40_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_526" class="fnanchor">40</a> In 1831 the cause was greatly
advanced by the signing of a treaty between Great Britain and
France, granting mutually a geographically limited Right of
Search.<a name="FNanchor_41_527" id="FNanchor_41_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_527" class="fnanchor">41</a> This led, in the next few years, to similar treaties
with Denmark, Sardinia,<a name="FNanchor_42_528" id="FNanchor_42_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_528" class="fnanchor">42</a> the Hanse towns,<a name="FNanchor_43_529" id="FNanchor_43_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_529" class="fnanchor">43</a> and Naples.<a name="FNanchor_44_530" id="FNanchor_44_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_530" class="fnanchor">44</a>
Such measures put the trade more and more in the hands of
Americans, and it began greatly to increase. Mercer sought
repeatedly in the House to have negotiations reopened with
England, but without success.<a name="FNanchor_45_531" id="FNanchor_45_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_531" class="fnanchor">45</a> Indeed, the chances of success
were now for many years imperilled by the recurrence of deliberate
search of American vessels by the British.<a name="FNanchor_46_532" id="FNanchor_46_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_532" class="fnanchor">46</a> In the majo<!-- Page 143 --><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>rity
of cases the vessels proved to be slavers, and some of
them fraudulently flew the American flag; nevertheless, their
molestation by British cruisers created much feeling, and hindered
all steps toward an understanding: the United States
was loath to have her criminal negligence in enforcing her
own laws thus exposed by foreigners. Other international
questions connected with the trade also strained the relations
of the two countries: three different vessels engaged in the
domestic slave-trade, driven by stress of weather, or, in the
"Creole" case, captured by Negroes on board, landed slaves
in British possessions; England freed them, and refused to
pay for such as were landed after emancipation had been proclaimed
in the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_47_533" id="FNanchor_47_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_533" class="fnanchor">47</a> The case of the slaver "L'Amistad"
also raised difficulties with Spain. This Spanish vessel,
after the Negroes on board had mutinied and killed their
owners, was seized by a United States vessel and brought into
port for adjudication. The court, however, freed the Negroes,
on the ground that under Spanish law they were not legally
slaves; and although the Senate repeatedly tried to indemnify
the owners, the project did not succeed.<a name="FNanchor_48_534" id="FNanchor_48_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_534" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>Such proceedings well illustrate the new tendency of the
pro-slavery party to neglect the enforcement of the slave-trade
laws, in a frantic defence of the remotest ramparts of slave
property. Consequently, when, after the treaty of 1831, France
and England joined in urging the accession of the United
States to it, the British minister was at last compelled to
inform Palmerston, December, 1833, that "the Executive at
Washington appears to shrink from bringing forward, in an<!-- Page 144 --><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>y
shape, a question, upon which depends the completion of
their former object&mdash;the utter and universal Abolition of the
Slave Trade&mdash;from an apprehension of alarming the Southern
States."<a name="FNanchor_49_535" id="FNanchor_49_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_535" class="fnanchor">49</a> Great Britain now offered to sign the proposed
treaty of 1824 as amended; but even this Forsyth refused, and
stated that the United States had determined not to become
"a party of any Convention on the subject of the Slave
Trade."<a name="FNanchor_50_536" id="FNanchor_50_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_536" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Estimates as to the extent of the slave-trade agree that the
traffic to North and South America in 1820 was considerable,
certainly not much less than 40,000 slaves annually. From
that time to about 1825 it declined somewhat, but afterward
increased enormously, so that by 1837 the American importation
was estimated as high as 200,000 Negroes annually. The
total abolition of the African trade by American countries
then brought the traffic down to perhaps 30,000 in 1842. A
large and rapid increase of illicit traffic followed; so that by
1847 the importation amounted to nearly 100,000 annually.
One province of Brazil is said to have received 173,000 in the
years 1846&ndash;1849. In the decade 1850&ndash;1860 this activity in
slave-trading continued, and reached very large proportions.</p>

<p>The traffic thus carried on floated under the flags of France,
Spain, and Portugal, until about 1830; from 1830 to 1840 it
began gradually to assume the United States flag; by 1845, a
large part of the trade was under the stars and stripes; by 1850
fully one-half the trade, and in the decade, 1850&ndash;1860 nearly
all the traffic, found this flag its best protection.<a name="FNanchor_51_537" id="FNanchor_51_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_537" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>
<p><!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">145</span></p>

<p>72. <b>The Quintuple Treaty, 1839&ndash;1842.</b> In 1839 Pope Gregory
XVI. stigmatized the slave-trade "as utterly unworthy of
the Christian name;" and at the same time, although proscribed
by the laws of every civilized State, the trade was flourishing
with pristine vigor. Great advantage was given the
traffic by the fact that the United States, for two decades after
the abortive attempt of 1824, refused to co-operate with the
rest of the civilized world, and allowed her flag to shelter and
protect the slave-trade. If a fully equipped slaver sailed from
New York, Havana, Rio Janeiro, or Liverpool, she had only
to hoist the stars and stripes in order to proceed unmolested
on her piratical voyage; for there was seldom a United States
<!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">146</span>cruiser to be met with, and there were, on the other hand,
diplomats at Washington so jealous of the honor of the flag
that they would prostitute it to crime rather than allow an
English or a French cruiser in any way to interfere. Without
doubt, the contention of the United States as to England's
pretensions to a Right of Visit was technically correct. Nevertheless,
it was clear that if the slave-trade was to be suppressed,
each nation must either zealously keep her flag from
fraudulent use, or, as a labor-saving device, depute to others
this duty for limited places and under special circumstances.
A failure of any one nation to do one of these two things
meant that the efforts of all other nations were to be fruitless.
The United States had invited the world to join her in denouncing
the slave-trade as piracy; yet, when such a pirate
was waylaid by an English vessel, the United States complained
or demanded reparation. The only answer which this
country for years returned to the long-continued exposures of
American slave-traders and of the fraudulent use of the American
flag, was a recital of cases where Great Britain had gone
beyond her legal powers in her attempt to suppress the slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_52_538" id="FNanchor_52_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_538" class="fnanchor">52</a>
In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
Secretary of State Forsyth declared, in 1840, that the duty of
the United States in the matter of the slave-trade "has been
faithfully performed, and if the traffic still exists as a disgrace
to humanity, it is to be imputed to nations with whom Her
Majesty's Government has formed and maintained the most
intimate connexions, and to whose Governments Great Britain
has paid for the right of active intervention in order to its
complete extirpation."<a name="FNanchor_53_539" id="FNanchor_53_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_539" class="fnanchor">53</a> So zealous was Stevenson, our minister
to England, in denying the Right of Search, that he
boldly informed Palmerston, in 1841, "that there is no shadow
of pretence for excusing, much less justifying, the exercise of
any such right. That it is wholly immaterial, whether the vessels
be equipped for, or actually engaged in slave traffic or
not, and consequently the right to search or detain even slave
vessels, must be confined to the ships or vessels of those
nations with whom it may have treaties on the subject."<a name="FNanchor_54_540" id="FNanchor_54_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_540" class="fnanchor">54</a>
Palmerston<!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a> courteously replied that he could not think that
the United States seriously intended to make its flag a refuge
for slave-traders;<a name="FNanchor_55_541" id="FNanchor_55_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_541" class="fnanchor">55</a> and Aberdeen pertinently declared: "Now,
it can scarcely be maintained by Mr. Stevenson that Great
Britain should be bound to permit her own subjects, with
British vessels and British capital, to carry on, before the eyes
of British officers, this detestable traffic in human beings,
which the law has declared to be piracy, merely because they
had the audacity to commit an additional offence by fraudulently
usurping the American flag."<a name="FNanchor_56_542" id="FNanchor_56_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_542" class="fnanchor">56</a> Thus the dispute, even
after the advent of Webster, went on for a time, involving
itself in metaphysical subtleties, and apparently leading no
nearer to an understanding.<a name="FNanchor_57_543" id="FNanchor_57_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_543" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>In 1838 a fourth conference of the powers for the consideration
of the slave-trade took place at London. It was attended
by representatives of England, France, Russia, Prussia, and
Austria. England laid the <i>projet</i> of a treaty before them, to
which all but France assented. This so-called Quintuple
Treaty, signed December 20, 1841, denounced the slave-trade
as piracy, and declared that "the High Contracting Parties
agree by common consent, that those of their ships of war
which shall be provided with special warrants and orders ...
may search every merchant-vessel belonging to any one of the
High Contracting Parties which shall, on reasonable grounds,
be suspected of being engaged in the traffic in slaves." All
captured slavers were to be sent to their own countries for
trial.<a name="FNanchor_58_544" id="FNanchor_58_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_544" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>While the ratification of this treaty was pending, the United
States minister to France, Lewis Cass, addressed an official
note to Guizot at the French foreign office, protesting against
the institution of an international Right of Search, and rather
grandiloquently warning the powers against the use of force
to accomplish their ends.<a name="FNanchor_59_545" id="FNanchor_59_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_545" class="fnanchor">59</a> This extraordinary epistle, issued
on the minister's own responsibility, brought a reply denying
<!-- Page 148 --><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>that the creation of any "new principle of international law,
whereby the vessels even of those powers which have not participated
in the arrangement should be subjected to the right
of search," was ever intended, and affirming that no such extraordinary
interpretation could be deduced from the Convention.
Moreover, M. Guizot hoped that the United States,
by agreeing to this treaty, would "aid, by its most sincere
endeavors, in the definitive abolition of the trade."<a name="FNanchor_60_546" id="FNanchor_60_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_546" class="fnanchor">60</a> Cass's
theatrical protest was, consciously or unconsciously, the manifesto
of that growing class in the United States who wanted
no further measures taken for the suppression of the slave-trade;
toward that, as toward the institution of slavery, this
party favored a policy of strict <i>laissez-faire</i>.</p>


<p>73. <b>Final Concerted Measures, 1842&ndash;1862.</b> The Treaty of
Washington, in 1842, made the first effective compromise in
the matter and broke the unpleasant dead-lock, by substituting
joint cruising by English and American squadrons for the
proposed grant of a Right of Search. In submitting this
treaty, Tyler said: "The treaty which I now submit to you
proposes no alteration, mitigation, or modification of the
rules of the law of nations. It provides simply that each of the
two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient
squadron to enforce separately and respectively the
laws, rights, and obligations of the two countries for the
suppression of the slave trade."<a name="FNanchor_61_547" id="FNanchor_61_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_547" class="fnanchor">61</a> This provision was a part of
the treaty to settle the boundary disputes with England. In
the Senate, Benton moved to strike out this article; but the
attempt was defeated by a vote of 37 to 12, and the treaty was
ratified.<a name="FNanchor_62_548" id="FNanchor_62_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_548" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>This stipulation of the treaty of 1842 was never properly
carried out by the United States for any length of time.<a name="FNanchor_63_549" id="FNanchor_63_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_549" class="fnanchor">63</a> Consequently
the same difficulties as to search and visit by English<!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>
vessels continued to recur. Cases like the following were
frequent. The "Illinois," of Gloucester, Massachusetts, while
lying at Whydah, Africa, was boarded by a British officer, but
having American papers was unmolested. Three days later she
hoisted Spanish colors and sailed away with a cargo of slaves.
Next morning she fell in with another British vessel and
hoisted American colors; the British ship had then no right
to molest her; but the captain of the slaver feared that she
would, and therefore ran his vessel aground, slaves and all.
The senior English officer reported that "had Lieutenant
Cumberland brought to and boarded the 'Illinois,' notwithstanding
the American colors which she hoisted, ... the
American master of the 'Illinois' ... would have complained
to his Government of the detention of his vessel."<a name="FNanchor_64_550" id="FNanchor_64_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_550" class="fnanchor">64</a> Again, a
vessel which had been boarded by British officers and found
with American flag and papers was, a little later, captured under
the Spanish flag with four hundred and thirty slaves. She
had in the interim complained to the United States government
of the boarding.<a name="FNanchor_65_551" id="FNanchor_65_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_551" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, England continued to urge the granting of a
Right of Search, claiming that the stand of the United States
really amounted to the wholesale protection of pirates under
her flag.<a name="FNanchor_66_552" id="FNanchor_66_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_552" class="fnanchor">66</a> The United States answered by alleging that even
the Treaty of 1842 had been misconstrued by England,<a name="FNanchor_67_553" id="FNanchor_67_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_553" class="fnanchor">67</a>
whereupon there was much warm debate in Congress, and
several attempts were made to abrogate the slave-trade article
of the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_68_554" id="FNanchor_68_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_554" class="fnanchor">68</a> The pro-slavery party had become more and
more suspicious of England's motives, since they had seen her
abolition of the slave-trade blossom into abolition of the system
itself, and they seized every opportunity to prevent co-operation
with her. At the same time, European interest in
the question showed some signs of weakening, and no decided
action was taken. In 1845 France changed her Right of<!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">150</span>
Search stipulations of 1833 to one for joint cruising,<a name="FNanchor_69_555" id="FNanchor_69_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_555" class="fnanchor">69</a> while the
Germanic Federation,<a name="FNanchor_70_556" id="FNanchor_70_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_556" class="fnanchor">70</a> Portugal,<a name="FNanchor_71_557" id="FNanchor_71_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_557" class="fnanchor">71</a> and Chili<a name="FNanchor_72_558" id="FNanchor_72_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_558" class="fnanchor">72</a>enounced the
trade as piracy. In 1844 Texas granted the Right of Search to
England,<a name="FNanchor_73_559" id="FNanchor_73_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_559" class="fnanchor">73</a> and in 1845 Belgium signed the Quintuple Treaty.<a name="FNanchor_74_560" id="FNanchor_74_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_560" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Discussion between England and the United States was revived
when Cass held the State portfolio, and, strange to say,
the author of "Cass's Protest" went farther than any of his
predecessors in acknowledging the justice of England's demands.
Said he, in 1859: "If The United States maintained
that, by carrying their flag at her masthead, any vessel became
thereby entitled to the immunity which belongs to American
vessels, they might well be reproached with assuming a position
which would go far towards shielding crimes upon the
ocean from punishment; but they advance no such pretension,
while they concede that, if in the honest examination of
a vessel sailing under American colours, but accompanied by
strongly-marked suspicious circumstances, a mistake is made,
and she is found to be entitled to the flag she bears, but no
injury is committed, and the conduct of the boarding party is
irreproachable, no Government would be likely to make a
case thus exceptional in its character a subject of serious reclamation."<a name="FNanchor_75_561" id="FNanchor_75_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_561" class="fnanchor">75</a>
While admitting this and expressing a desire to
co-operate in the suppression of the slave-trade, Cass nevertheless
steadily refused all further overtures toward a
mutual Right of Search.</p>

<p>The increase of the slave-traffic was so great in the decade
1850&ndash;1860 that Lord John Russell proposed to the governments
of the United States, France, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil,
that they instruct their ministers to meet at London in
May or June, 1860, to consider measures for the final abolition
of the trade. He stated: "It is ascertained, by repeated instances,
<!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">151</span>that the practice is for vessels to sail under the American
flag. If the flag is rightly assumed, and the papers correct,
no British cruizer can touch them. If no slaves are on board,
even though the equipment, the fittings, the water-casks, and
other circumstances prove that the ship is on a Slave Trade
venture, no American cruizer can touch them."<a name="FNanchor_76_562" id="FNanchor_76_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_562" class="fnanchor">76</a> Continued
representations of this kind were made to the paralyzed
United States government; indeed, the slave-trade of the
world seemed now to float securely under her flag. Nevertheless,
Cass refused even to participate in the proposed conference,
and later refused to accede to a proposal for joint
cruising off the coast of Cuba.<a name="FNanchor_77_563" id="FNanchor_77_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_563" class="fnanchor">77</a> Great Britain offered to relieve
the United States of any embarrassment by receiving all
captured Africans into the West Indies; but President Buchanan
"could not contemplate any such arrangement," and
obstinately refused to increase the suppressing squadron.<a name="FNanchor_78_564" id="FNanchor_78_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_564" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Civil War, the Lincoln administration,
through Secretary Seward, immediately expressed a willingness
to do all in its power to suppress the slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_79_565" id="FNanchor_79_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_565" class="fnanchor">79</a>
Accordingly, June 7, 1862, a treaty was signed with Great Britain
granting a mutual limited Right of Search, and establishing
mixed courts for the trial of offenders at the Cape of
Good Hope, Sierra Leone, and New York.<a name="FNanchor_80_566" id="FNanchor_80_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_566" class="fnanchor">80</a> The efforts of a
half-century of diplomacy were finally crowned; Seward
wrote to Adams, "Had such a treaty been made in 1808, there
would now have been no sedition here."<a name="FNanchor_81_567" id="FNanchor_81_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_567" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

to agreement; they assembled Dec. 4, 1817, and finally called a meeting of
plenipotentiaries on the question of suppression at Aix-la-Chapelle, beginning
Oct. 24, 1818. Among those present were Metternich, Richelieu, Wellington,
Castlereagh, Hardenberg, Bernstorff, Nesselrode, and Capodistrias.
Castlereagh made two propositions: 1. That the five powers join in urging
Portugal and Brazil to abolish the trade May 20, 1820; 2. That the powers
adopt the principle of a mutual qualified Right of Search. Cf. <i>British and

United States to co-operate in suppressing the trade was the United States of
Colombia. Mr. Anderson, our minister, expressed "the certain belief that the
Republic of Colombia will not permit herself to be behind any Government
in the civilized world in the adoption of energetic measures for the suppression
of this disgraceful traffic": <i>Ibid.</i>, No. 407, p. 729. The little republic
replied courteously; and, as a <i>projet</i> for a treaty, Mr. Anderson offered the
proposed English treaty of 1824, including the Senate amendments. Nevertheless,
the treaty thus agreed to was summarily rejected by the Senate,
March 9, 1825: <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 735. Another result of this general invitation of the
United States was a proposal by Colombia that the slave-trade and the status
of Hayti be among the subjects for discussion at the Panama Congress. As a
result of this, a Senate committee recommended that the United States take
no part in the Congress. This report was finally disagreed to by a vote of 19
to 24: <i>Ibid.</i>, No. 423, pp. 837, 860, 876, 882.</p></div>

<p>74. <b>The Economic Revolution.</b> The history of slavery and
the slave-trade after 1820 must be read in the light of the industrial
revolution through which the civilized world passed
in the first half of the nineteenth century. Between the years
1775 and 1825 occurred economic events and changes of the
highest importance and widest influence. Though all branches
of industry felt the impulse of this new industrial life, yet, "if
we consider single industries, cotton manufacture has, during
the nineteenth century, made the most magnificent and gigantic
advances."<a name="FNanchor_1_568" id="FNanchor_1_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_568" class="fnanchor">1</a> This fact is easily explained by the remarkable
series of inventions that revolutionized this industry between
1738 and 1830, including Arkwright's, Watt's, Compton's, and
Cartwright's epoch-making contrivances.<a name="FNanchor_2_569" id="FNanchor_2_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_569" class="fnanchor">2</a> The effect which
these inventions had on the manufacture of cotton goods is
best illustrated by the fact that in England, the chief cotton
<!-- Page 153 --><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>market of the world, the consumption of raw cotton rose
steadily from 13,000 bales in 1781, to 572,000 in 1820, to
871,000 in 1830, and to 3,366,000 in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_3_570" id="FNanchor_3_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_570" class="fnanchor">3</a> Very early, therefore,
came the query whence the supply of raw cotton was to
come. Tentative experiments on the rich, broad fields of the
Southern United States, together with the indispensable invention
of Whitney's cotton-gin, soon answered this question:
a new economic future was opened up to this land, and
immediately the whole South began to extend its cotton culture,
and more and more to throw its whole energy into this
one staple.</p>

<p>Here it was that the fatal mistake of compromising with
slavery in the beginning, and of the policy of <i>laissez-faire</i> pursued
thereafter, became painfully manifest; for, instead now
of a healthy, normal, economic development along proper industrial
lines, we have the abnormal and fatal rise of a slave-labor
large farming system, which, before it was realized, had
so intertwined itself with and braced itself upon the economic
forces of an industrial age, that a vast and terrible civil war
was necessary to displace it. The tendencies to a patriarchal
serfdom, recognizable in the age of Washington and Jefferson,
began slowly but surely to disappear; and in the second
quarter of the century Southern slavery was irresistibly changing
from a family institution to an industrial system.</p>

<p>The development of Southern slavery has heretofore been
viewed so exclusively from the ethical and social standpoint
that we are apt to forget its close and indissoluble connection
with the world's cotton market. Beginning with 1820, a little
after the close of the Napoleonic wars, when the industry of
cotton manufacture had begun its modern development and
the South had definitely assumed her position as chief producer
of raw cotton, we find the average price of cotton per
pound, 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> From this time until 1845 the price steadily fell,
until in the latter year it reached 4<i>d.</i>; the only exception to
this fall was in the years 1832&ndash;1839, when, among other
things, a strong increase in the English demand, together
with an attempt of the young slave power to "corner" the
market, sent the price up as high as 11<i>d.</i> The demand for cotton
<!-- Page 154 --><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum">154</span>goods soon outran a crop which McCullough had pronounced
"prodigious," and after 1845 the price started on a
steady rise, which, except for the checks suffered during the
continental revolutions and the Crimean War, continued until
1860.<a name="FNanchor_4_571" id="FNanchor_4_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_571" class="fnanchor">4</a> The steady increase in the production of cotton explains
the fall in price down to 1845. In 1822 the crop was a
half-million bales; in 1831, a million; in 1838, a million and a
half; and in 1840&ndash;1843, two million. By this time the world's
consumption of cotton goods began to increase so rapidly
that, in spite of the increase in Southern crops, the price kept
rising. Three million bales were gathered in 1852, three and a
half million in 1856, and the remarkable crop of five million
bales in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_5_572" id="FNanchor_5_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_572" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Here we have data to explain largely the economic development
of the South. By 1822 the large-plantation slave system
had gained footing; in 1838&ndash;1839 it was able to show its
power in the cotton "corner;" by the end of the next decade
it had not only gained a solid economic foundation, but it
had built a closed oligarchy with a political policy. The
changes in price during the next few years drove out of competition
many survivors of the small-farming free-labor system,
and put the slave <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in position to dictate the policy
of the nation. The zenith of the system and the first inevitable
signs of decay came in the years 1850&ndash;1860, when the rising
price of cotton threw the whole economic energy of the
South into its cultivation, leading to a terrible consumption
of soil and slaves, to a great increase in the size of plantations,
and to increasing power and effrontery on the part of the
slave barons. Finally, when a rising moral crusade conjoined
with threatened economic disaster, the oligarchy, encouraged
by the state of the cotton market, risked all on a political <i>coup-d'&eacute;tat</i>,
which failed in the war of 1861&ndash;1865.<a name="FNanchor_6_573" id="FNanchor_6_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_573" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>


<p>75. <b>The Attitude of the South.</b> The attitude of the South
toward the slave-trade changed <i>pari passu</i> with this development
of the cotton trade. From 1808 to 1820 the South half
wished to get rid of a troublesome and abnormal institution,
<!-- Page 155 --><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>and yet saw no way to do so. The fear of insurrection and of
the further spread of the disagreeable system led her to consent
to the partial prohibition of the trade by severe national
enactments. Nevertheless, she had in the matter no settled
policy: she refused to support vigorously the execution of the
laws she had helped to make, and at the same time she acknowledged
the theoretical necessity of these laws. After 1820,
however, there came a gradual change. The South found herself
supplied with a body of slave laborers, whose number had
been augmented by large illicit importations, with an abundance
of rich land, and with all other natural facilities for raising
a crop which was in large demand and peculiarly adapted
to slave labor. The increasing crop caused a new demand for
slaves, and an interstate slave-traffic arose between the Border
and the Gulf States, which turned the former into slave-breeding
districts, and bound them to the slave States by ties
of strong economic interest.</p>

<p>As the cotton crop continued to increase, this source of
supply became inadequate, especially as the theory of land
and slave consumption broke down former ethical and prudential
bounds. It was, for example, found cheaper to work a
slave to death in a few years, and buy a new one, than to care
for him in sickness and old age; so, too, it was easier to despoil
rich, new land in a few years of intensive culture, and
move on to the Southwest, than to fertilize and conserve the
soil.<a name="FNanchor_7_574" id="FNanchor_7_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_574" class="fnanchor">7</a> Consequently, there early came a demand for land and
slaves greater than the country could supply. The demand for
land showed itself in the annexation of Texas, the conquest of
Mexico, and the movement toward the acquisition of Cuba.
The demand for slaves was manifested in the illicit traffic that
noticeably increased about 1835, and reached large proportions
by 1860. It was also seen in a disposition to attack the government
for stigmatizing the trade as criminal,<a name="FNanchor_8_575" id="FNanchor_8_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_575" class="fnanchor">8</a> then in a disinclination
to take any measures which would have rendered
our repressive laws effective; and finally in such articulate
declarations by prominent men as this: "Experience having
<!-- Page 156 --><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">156</span>settled the point, that this Trade <i>cannot be abolished by the use
of force</i>, and that blockading squadrons serve only to make it
more profitable and more cruel, I am surprised that the attempt
is persisted in, unless as it serves as a cloak to some
other purposes. It would be far better than it now is, for the
African, if the trade was free from all restrictions, and left to
the mitigation and decay which time and competition would
surely bring about."<a name="FNanchor_9_576" id="FNanchor_9_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_576" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>


<p>76. <b>The Attitude of the North and Congress.</b> With the
North as yet unawakened to the great changes taking place
in the South, and with the attitude of the South thus in process
of development, little or no constructive legislation
could be expected on the subject of the slave-trade. As the
divergence in sentiment became more and more pronounced,
there were various attempts at legislation, all of which
proved abortive. The pro-slavery party attempted, as early as
1826, and again in 1828, to abolish the African agency and
leave the Africans practically at the mercy of the States;<a name="FNanchor_10_577" id="FNanchor_10_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_577" class="fnanchor">10</a> one
or two attempts were made to relax the few provisions
which restrained the coastwise trade;<a name="FNanchor_11_578" id="FNanchor_11_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_578" class="fnanchor">11</a> and, after the treaty of
1842, Benton proposed to stop appropriations for the African
squadron until England defined her position on the
Right of Search question.<a name="FNanchor_12_579" id="FNanchor_12_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_579" class="fnanchor">12</a> The anti-slavery men presented
several bills to amend and strengthen previous laws;<a name="FNanchor_13_580" id="FNanchor_13_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_580" class="fnanchor">13</a> they
sought, for instance, in vain to regulate the Texan trade,
through which numbers of slaves indirectly reached the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_14_581" id="FNanchor_14_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_581" class="fnanchor">14</a> Presidents and consuls earnestly re<!-- Page 157 --><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">157</span>commended
legislation to restrict the clearances of vessels bound
on slave-trading voyages, and to hinder the facility with
which slavers obtained fraudulent papers.<a name="FNanchor_15_582" id="FNanchor_15_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_582" class="fnanchor">15</a> Only one such
bill succeeded in passing the Senate, and that was dropped
in the House.<a name="FNanchor_16_583" id="FNanchor_16_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_583" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The only legislation of this period was confined to a few
appropriation bills. Only one of these acts, that of 1823, appropriating
$50,000,<a name="FNanchor_17_584" id="FNanchor_17_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_584" class="fnanchor">17</a> was designed materially to aid in the
suppression of the trade, all the others relating to expenses
incurred after violations. After 1823 the appropriations dwindled,
being made at intervals of one, two, and three years,
down to 1834, when the amount was $5,000. No further appropriations
were made until 1842, when a few thousands
above an unexpended surplus were appropriated. In 1843
$5,000 were given, and finally, in 1846, $25,000 were secured;
but this was the last sum obtainable until 1856.<a name="FNanchor_18_585" id="FNanchor_18_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_585" class="fnanchor">18</a> Nearly all of
these meagre appropriations went toward reimbursing Southern
plantation owners for the care and support of illegally
imported Africans, and the rest to the maintenance of the African
agency. Suspiciously large sums were paid for the first
purpose, considering the fact that such Africans were always
worked hard by those to whom they were farmed out, and
often "disappeared" while in their hands. In the accounts we
nevertheless find many items like that of $20,286.98 for the
maintenance of Negroes imported on the "Ramirez;"<a name="FNanchor_19_586" id="FNanchor_19_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_586" class="fnanchor">19</a> in 1827,
$5,442.22 for the "bounty, subsistence, clothing, medicine,"
etc., of fifteen Africans;<a name="FNanchor_20_587" id="FNanchor_20_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_587" class="fnanchor">20</a> in 1835, $3,613 for the support of
thirty-eight slaves for two months (including a bill of $1,038
<!-- Page 158 --><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum">158</span>for medical attendance).<a name="FNanchor_21_588" id="FNanchor_21_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_588" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The African agency suffered many vicissitudes. The first
agent, Bacon, who set out early in 1820, was authorized by
President Monroe "to form an establishment on the island of
Sherbro, or elsewhere on the coast of Africa," and to build
barracks for three hundred persons. He was, however, warned
"not to connect your agency with the views or plans of the
Colonization Society, with which, under the law, the Government
of the United States has no concern." Bacon soon died,
and was followed during the next four years by Winn and
Ayres; they succeeded in establishing a government agency on
Cape Mesurado, in conjunction with that of the Colonization
Society. The agent of that Society, Jehudi Ashmun, became
after 1822, the virtual head of the colony; he fortified and enlarged
it, and laid the foundations of an independent community.
The succeeding government agents came to be
merely official representatives of the United States, and the
distribution of free rations for liberated Africans ceased in
1827.</p>

<p>Between 1819 and 1830 two hundred and fifty-two recaptured
Africans were sent to the agency, and $264,710 were
expended. The property of the government at the agency was
valued at $18,895. From 1830 to 1840, nearly $20,000 more
were expended, chiefly for the agents' salaries. About 1840 the
appointment of an agent ceased, and the colony became gradually
self-supporting and independent. It was proclaimed as
the Republic of Liberia in 1847.<a name="FNanchor_22_589" id="FNanchor_22_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_589" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>
<p><!-- Page 159 --><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pagenum">159</span></p>

<p>77. <b>Imperfect Application of the Laws.</b> In reviewing efforts
toward the suppression of the slave-trade from 1820 to
1850, it must be remembered that nearly every cabinet had a
strong, if not a predominating, Southern element, and that
consequently the efforts of the executive were powerfully
influenced by the changing attitude of the South. Naturally,
under such circumstances, the government displayed little activity
and no enthusiasm in the work. In 1824 a single vessel
of the Gulf squadron was occasionally sent to the African
coast to return by the route usually followed by the slavers;
no wonder that "none of these or any other of our public
ships have found vessels engaged in the slave trade under the
flag of the United States, ... although it is known that the
trade still exists to a most lamentable extent."<a name="FNanchor_23_590" id="FNanchor_23_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_590" class="fnanchor">23</a> Indeed, all that
an American slaver need do was to run up a Spanish or a
Portuguese flag, to be absolutely secure from all attack or inquiry
on the part of United States vessels. Even this desultory
method of suppression was not regular: in 1826 "no vessel has
been despatched to the coast of Africa for several months,"<a name="FNanchor_24_591" id="FNanchor_24_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_591" class="fnanchor">24</a>
and from that time until 1839 this country probably had no
slave-trade police upon the seas, except in the Gulf of Mexico.
In 1839 increasing violations led to the sending of two fast-sailing
vessels to the African coast, and these were kept there
more or less regularly;<a name="FNanchor_25_592" id="FNanchor_25_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_592" class="fnanchor">25</a> but even after the signing of the
treaty of 1842 the Secretary of the Navy reports: "On the coast
of Africa we have <i>no</i> squadron. The small appropriation of
the present year was believed to be scarcely sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_26_593" id="FNanchor_26_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_593" class="fnanchor">26</a> Between
1843 and 1850 the coast squadron varied from two to
six vessels, with from thirty to ninety-eight guns;<a name="FNanchor_27_594" id="FNanchor_27_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_594" class="fnanchor">27</a> "but the
force habitually and actively engaged in cruizing on the
ground frequented by slavers has probably been less by one-fourth,
if we consider the size of the ships employed and their
withdrawal for purposes of recreation and health, and the
movement of the reliefs, whose arrival does not correspond
exactly with the departure of the vessels whose term of service
<!-- Page 160 --><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">160</span>has expired."<a name="FNanchor_28_595" id="FNanchor_28_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_595" class="fnanchor">28</a> The reports of the navy show that in only four
of the eight years mentioned was the fleet, at the time of report,
at the stipulated size of eighty guns; and at times it was
much below this, even as late as 1848, when only two vessels
are reported on duty along the African coast.<a name="FNanchor_29_596" id="FNanchor_29_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_596" class="fnanchor">29</a> As the commanders
themselves acknowledged, the squadron was too
small and the cruising-ground too large to make joint cruising
effective.<a name="FNanchor_30_597" id="FNanchor_30_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_597" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The same story comes from the Brazil station: "Nothing
effectual can be done towards stopping the slave trade, as our
squadron is at present organized," wrote the consul at Rio
Janeiro in 1847; "when it is considered that the Brazil station
extends from north of the equator to Cape Horn on this continent,
and includes a great part of Africa south of the equator,
on both sides of the Cape of Good Hope, it must be
admitted that one frigate and one brig is a very insufficient
force to protect American commerce, and repress the participation
in the slave trade by our own vessels."<a name="FNanchor_31_598" id="FNanchor_31_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_598" class="fnanchor">31</a> In the Gulf of
Mexico cruisers were stationed most of the time, although
even here there were at times urgent representations that the
scarcity or the absence of such vessels gave the illicit trade
great license.<a name="FNanchor_32_599" id="FNanchor_32_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_599" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Owing to this general negligence of the government, and
also to its anxiety on the subject of the theoretic Right of
Search, many officials were kept in a state of chronic deception
in regard to the trade. The enthusiasm of commanders
was dampened by the lack of latitude allowed and by the repeated
<!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>insistence in their orders on the non-existence of a
Right of Search.<a name="FNanchor_33_600" id="FNanchor_33_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_600" class="fnanchor">33</a> When one commander, realizing that he
could not cover the trading-track with his fleet, requested English
commanders to detain suspicious American vessels until
one of his vessels came up, the government annulled the
agreement as soon as it reached their ears, rebuked him, and
the matter was alluded to in Congress long after with horror.<a name="FNanchor_34_601" id="FNanchor_34_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_601" class="fnanchor">34</a>
According to the orders of cruisers, only slavers with
slaves actually on board could be seized. Consequently, fully
equipped slavers would sail past the American fleet, deliberately
make all preparations for shipping a cargo, then, when
the English were not near, "sell" the ship to a Spaniard, hoist
the Spanish flag, and again sail gayly past the American fleet
with a cargo of slaves. An English commander reported: "The
officers of the United States' navy are extremely active and
zealous in the cause, and no fault can be attributed to them,
but it is greatly to be lamented that this blemish should in so
great a degree nullify our endeavours."<a name="FNanchor_35_602" id="FNanchor_35_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_602" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>


<p>78. <b>Responsibility of the Government.</b> Not only did the
government thus negatively favor the slave-trade, but also
many conscious, positive acts must be attributed to a spirit
hostile to the proper enforcement of the slave-trade laws. In
cases of doubt, when the law needed executive interpretation,
the decision was usually in favor of the looser construction
of the law; the trade from New Orleans to Mobile was,
for instance, declared not to be coastwise trade, and consequently,
to the joy of the Cuban smugglers, was left utterly
free and unrestricted.<a name="FNanchor_36_603" id="FNanchor_36_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_603" class="fnanchor">36</a> After the conquest of Mexico, even
vessels bound to California, by the way of Cape Horn, were
<!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">162</span>allowed to clear coastwise, thus giving our flag to "the slave-pirates
of the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_37_604" id="FNanchor_37_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_604" class="fnanchor">37</a> Attorney-General Nelson declared
that the selling to a slave-trader of an American vessel,
to be delivered on the coast of Africa, was not aiding or
abetting the slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_38_605" id="FNanchor_38_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_605" class="fnanchor">38</a> So easy was it for slavers to sail
that corruption among officials was hinted at. "There is certainly
a want of proper vigilance at Havana," wrote Commander
Perry in 1844, "and perhaps at the ports of the
United States;" and again, in the same year, "I cannot but
think that the custom-house authorities in the United States
are not sufficiently rigid in looking after vessels of suspicious
character."<a name="FNanchor_39_606" id="FNanchor_39_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_606" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>In the courts it was still next to impossible to secure the
punishment of the most notorious slave-trader. In 1847 a consul
writes: "The slave power in this city [i.e., Rio Janeiro] is
extremely great, and a consul doing his duty needs to be supported
kindly and effectually at home. In the case of the
'Fame,' where the vessel was diverted from the business intended
by her owners and employed in the slave trade&mdash;both
of which offences are punishable with death, if I rightly read
the laws&mdash;I sent home the two mates charged with these offences,
for trial, the first mate to Norfolk, the second mate to
Philadelphia. What was done with the first mate I know not.
In the case of the man sent to Philadelphia, Mr. Commissioner
Kane states that a clear prima facie case is made out,
and then holds him to bail in the sum of <i>one thousand dollars</i>,
which would be paid by any slave trader in Rio, on the <i>presentation
of a draft</i>. In all this there is little encouragement for
exertion."<a name="FNanchor_40_607" id="FNanchor_40_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_607" class="fnanchor">40</a> Again, the "Perry" in 1850 captured a slaver which
was about to ship 1,800 slaves. The captain admitted his guilt,
and was condemned in the United States District Court at
New York. Nevertheless, he was admitted to bail of $5,000;
this being afterward reduced to $3,000, he forfeited it and
escaped. The mate was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary.<a name="FNanchor_41_608" id="FNanchor_41_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_608" class="fnanchor">41</a>
<!-- Page 163 --><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>Also several slavers sent home to the United States by
the British, with clear evidence of guilt, escaped condemnation
through technicalities.<a name="FNanchor_42_609" id="FNanchor_42_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_609" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>


<p>79. <b>Activity of the Slave-Trade, 1820&ndash;1850.</b> The enhanced
price of slaves throughout the American slave market,
brought about by the new industrial development and the
laws against the slave-trade, was the irresistible temptation
that drew American capital and enterprise into that traffic. In
the United States, in spite of the large interstate traffic, the
average price of slaves rose from about $325 in 1840, to $360
in 1850, and to $500 in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_43_610" id="FNanchor_43_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_610" class="fnanchor">43</a> Brazil and Cuba offered similar
inducements to smugglers, and the American flag was ready
to protect such pirates. As a result, the American slave-trade
finally came to be carried on principally by United States capital,
in United States ships, officered by United States citizens,
and under the United States flag.</p>

<p>Executive reports repeatedly acknowledged this fact. In 1839
"a careful revision of these laws" is recommended by the President,
in order that "the integrity and honor of our flag may
be carefully preserved."<a name="FNanchor_44_611" id="FNanchor_44_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_611" class="fnanchor">44</a> In June, 1841, the President declares:
"There is reason to believe that the traffic is on the increase,"
and advocates "vigorous efforts."<a name="FNanchor_45_612" id="FNanchor_45_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_612" class="fnanchor">45</a> His message in December
of the same year acknowledges: "That the American flag is
grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations
is but too probable."<a name="FNanchor_46_613" id="FNanchor_46_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_613" class="fnanchor">46</a> The special message of 1845 explains
at length that "it would seem" that a regular policy of
evading the laws is carried on: American vessels with the
knowledge of the owners are chartered by notorious slave
dealers in Brazil, aided by English capitalists, with this intent.<a name="FNanchor_47_614" id="FNanchor_47_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_614" class="fnanchor">47</a>
The message of 1849 "earnestly" invites the attention of
Congress "to an amendment of our existing laws relating to
the African slave-trade, with a view to the effectual suppression
<!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">164</span>of that barbarous traffic. It is not to be denied," continues
the message, "that this trade is still, in part, carried on by
means of vessels built in the United States, and owned or
navigated by some of our citizens."<a name="FNanchor_48_615" id="FNanchor_48_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_615" class="fnanchor">48</a> Governor Buchanan of
Liberia reported in 1839: "The chief obstacle to the success of
the very active measures pursued by the British government
for the suppression of the slave-trade on the coast, is the
<i>American flag</i>. Never was the proud banner of freedom so
extensively used by those pirates upon liberty and humanity,
as at this season."<a name="FNanchor_49_616" id="FNanchor_49_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_616" class="fnanchor">49</a> One well-known American slaver was
boarded fifteen times and twice taken into port, but always
escaped by means of her papers.<a name="FNanchor_50_617" id="FNanchor_50_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_617" class="fnanchor">50</a> Even American officers report
that the English are doing all they can, but that the
American flag protects the trade.<a name="FNanchor_51_618" id="FNanchor_51_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_618" class="fnanchor">51</a> The evidence which literally
poured in from our consuls and ministers at Brazil adds
to the story of the guilt of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_52_619" id="FNanchor_52_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_619" class="fnanchor">52</a> It was proven
that the participation of United States citizens in the trade
was large and systematic. One of the most notorious slave
merchants of Brazil said: "I am worried by the Americans,
who insist upon my hiring their vessels for slave-trade."<a name="FNanchor_53_620" id="FNanchor_53_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_620" class="fnanchor">53</a>
Minister Proffit stated, in 1844, that the "slave-trade is almost
entirely carried on under our flag, in American-built
vessels."<a name="FNanchor_54_621" id="FNanchor_54_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_621" class="fnanchor">54</a> So, too, in Cuba: the British commissioners affirm
that American citizens were openly engaged in the traffic;
vessels arrived undisguised at Havana from the United
States, and cleared for Africa as slavers after an alleged sale.<a name="FNanchor_55_622" id="FNanchor_55_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_622" class="fnanchor">55</a>
The American consul, Trist, was proven to have consciously
or unconsciously aided this trade by the issuance of blank
<!-- Page 165 --><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>clearance papers.<a name="FNanchor_56_623" id="FNanchor_56_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_623" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The presence of American capital in these enterprises, and
the connivance of the authorities, were proven in many cases
and known in scores. In 1837 the English government informed
the United States that from the papers of a captured
slaver it appeared that the notorious slave-trading firm,
Blanco and Carballo of Havana, who owned the vessel, had
correspondents in the United States: "at Baltimore, Messrs.
Peter Harmony and Co., in New York, Robert Barry, Esq."<a name="FNanchor_57_624" id="FNanchor_57_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_624" class="fnanchor">57</a>
The slaver "Martha" of New York, captured by the "Perry,"
contained among her papers curious revelations of the guilt
of persons in America who were little suspected.<a name="FNanchor_58_625" id="FNanchor_58_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_625" class="fnanchor">58</a> The slaver
"Prova," which was allowed to lie in the harbor of Charleston,
South Carolina, and refit, was afterwards captured with
two hundred and twenty-five slaves on board.<a name="FNanchor_59_626" id="FNanchor_59_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_626" class="fnanchor">59</a> The real reason
that prevented many belligerent Congressmen from pressing
certain search claims against England lay in the fact that
the unjustifiable detentions had unfortunately revealed so
much American guilt that it was deemed wiser to let the matter
end in talk. For instance, in 1850 Congress demanded information
as to illegal searches, and President Fillmore's
report showed the uncomfortable fact that, of the ten American
ships wrongly detained by English men-of-war, nine were
proven red-handed slavers.<a name="FNanchor_60_627" id="FNanchor_60_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_627" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The consul at Havana reported, in 1836, that whole cargoes
of slaves fresh from Africa were being daily shipped to Texas
in American vessels, that 1,000 had been sent within a few
months, that the rate was increasing, and that many of these
slaves "can scarcely fail to find their way into the United
States." Moreover, the consul acknowledged that ships frequently
cleared for the United States in ballast, taking on a
cargo at some secret point.<a name="FNanchor_61_628" id="FNanchor_61_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_628" class="fnanchor">61</a> When with these facts we consider
<!-- Page 166 --><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>the law facilitating "recovery" of slaves from Texas,<a name="FNanchor_62_629" id="FNanchor_62_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_629" class="fnanchor">62</a> the
repeated refusals to regulate the Texan trade, and the shelving
of a proposed congressional investigation into these matters,<a name="FNanchor_63_630" id="FNanchor_63_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_630" class="fnanchor">63</a>
conjecture becomes a practical certainty. It was estimated in
1838 that 15,000 Africans were annually taken to Texas, and
"there are even grounds for suspicion that there are other
places ... where slaves are introduced."<a name="FNanchor_64_631" id="FNanchor_64_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_631" class="fnanchor">64</a> Between 1847 and
1853 the slave smuggler Drake had a slave depot in the Gulf,
where sometimes as many as 1,600 Negroes were on hand,
and the owners were continually importing and shipping.
"The joint-stock company," writes this smuggler, "was a very
extensive one, and connected with leading American and
Spanish mercantile houses. Our island<a name="FNanchor_65_632" id="FNanchor_65_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_632" class="fnanchor">65</a> was visited almost
weekly, by agents from Cuba, New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Boston, and New Orleans.... The seasoned and
instructed slaves were taken to Texas, or Florida, overland,
and to Cuba, in sailing-boats. As no squad contained more
than half a dozen, no difficulty was found in posting them to
the United States, without discovery, and generally without
suspicion.... The Bay Island plantation sent ventures
weekly to the Florida Keys. Slaves were taken into the great
American swamps, and there kept till wanted for the market.
Hundreds were sold as captured runaways from the Florida
wilderness. We had agents in every slave State; and our coasters
were built in Maine, and came out with lumber. I could
tell curious stories ... of this business of smuggling Bozal
negroes into the United States. It is growing more profitable
every year, and if you should hang all the Yankee merchants
engaged in it, hundreds would fill their places."<a name="FNanchor_66_633" id="FNanchor_66_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_633" class="fnanchor">66</a> Inherent
<!-- Page 167 --><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>probability and concurrent testimony confirm the substantial
truth of such confessions. For instance, one traveller discovers
on a Southern plantation Negroes who can speak no English.<a name="FNanchor_67_634" id="FNanchor_67_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_634" class="fnanchor">67</a>
The careful reports of the Quakers "apprehend that
many [slaves] are also introduced into the United States."<a name="FNanchor_68_635" id="FNanchor_68_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_635" class="fnanchor">68</a>
Governor Mathew of the Bahama Islands reports that "in
more than one instance, Bahama vessels with coloured crews
have been purposely wrecked on the coast of Florida, and the
crews forcibly sold." This was brought to the notice of the
United States authorities, but the district attorney of Florida
could furnish no information.<a name="FNanchor_69_636" id="FNanchor_69_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_636" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of the slave-trade in 1850, on the threshold
of the critical decade which by a herculean effort was destined
finally to suppress it.</p>

<p>80. <b>The Movement against the Slave-Trade Laws.</b> It was
not altogether a mistaken judgment that led the constitutional
fathers to consider the slave-trade as the backbone of slavery.
An economic system based on slave labor will find, sooner or
later, that the demand for the cheapest slave labor cannot
long be withstood. Once degrade the laborer so that he cannot
assert his own rights, and there is but one limit below
which his price cannot be reduced. That limit is not his physical
well-being, for it may be, and in the Gulf States it was,
cheaper to work him rapidly to death; the limit is simply the
cost of procuring him and keeping him alive a profitable
length of time. Only the moral sense of a community can
keep helpless labor from sinking to this level; and when a
community has once been debauched by slavery, its moral
sense offers little resistance to economic demand. This was
the case in the West Indies and Brazil; and although better
moral stamina held the crisis back longer in the United States,
yet even here the ethical standard of the South was not able
to maintain itself against the demands of the cotton industry.
When, after 1850, the price of slaves had risen to a monopoly
height, the leaders of the plantation system, brought to the
edge of bankruptcy by the crude and reckless farming necessary
under a slave <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and baffled, at least temporarily, in
their quest of new rich land to exploit, began instinctively to
feel that the only salvation of American slavery lay in the reopening
<!-- Page 169 --><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>of the African slave-trade.</p>

<p>It took but a spark to put this instinctive feeling into
words, and words led to deeds. The movement first took definite
form in the ever radical State of South Carolina. In 1854
a grand jury in the Williamsburg district declared, "as our
unanimous opinion, that the Federal law abolishing the African
Slave Trade is a public grievance. We hold this trade has
been and would be, if re-established, a blessing to the American
people, and a benefit to the African himself."<a name="FNanchor_1_637" id="FNanchor_1_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_637" class="fnanchor">1</a> This attracted
only local attention; but when, in 1856, the governor
of the State, in his annual message, calmly argued at length
for a reopening of the trade, and boldly declared that "if we
cannot supply the demand for slave labor, then we must expect
to be supplied with a species of labor we do not want,"<a name="FNanchor_2_638" id="FNanchor_2_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_638" class="fnanchor">2</a>
such words struck even Southern ears like "a thunder clap in
a calm day."<a name="FNanchor_3_639" id="FNanchor_3_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_639" class="fnanchor">3</a> And yet it needed but a few years to show that
South Carolina had merely been the first to put into words
the inarticulate thought of a large minority, if not a majority,
of the inhabitants of the Gulf States.</p>


<p>81. <b>Commercial Conventions of 1855&ndash;56.</b> The growth of
the movement is best followed in the action of the Southern
Commercial Convention, an annual gathering which seems to
have been fairly representative of a considerable part of
Southern opinion. In the convention that met at New Orleans
in 1855, McGimsey of Louisiana introduced a resolution
instructing the Southern Congressmen to secure the repeal of
the slave-trade laws. This resolution went to the Committee
on Resolutions, and was not reported.<a name="FNanchor_4_640" id="FNanchor_4_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_640" class="fnanchor">4</a> In 1856, in the convention
at Savannah, W.B. Goulden of Georgia moved that
the members of Congress be requested to bestir themselves
energetically to have repealed all laws which forbade the slave-trade.
By a vote of 67 to 18 the convention refused to debate
the motion, but appointed a committee to present at the next
convention the facts relating to a reopening of the trade.<a name="FNanchor_5_641" id="FNanchor_5_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_641" class="fnanchor">5</a> In
regard to this action a pamphlet of the day said: "There were
<!-- Page 170 --><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>introduced into the convention two leading measures, viz.:
the laying of a State tariff on northern goods, and the reopening
of the slave-trade; the one to advance our commercial interest,
the other our agricultural interest, and which, when
taken together, as they were doubtless intended to be, and
although they have each been attacked by presses of doubtful
service to the South, are characterized in the private judgment
of politicians as one of the completest southern remedies ever
submitted to popular action.... The proposition to revive,
or more properly to reopen, the slave trade is as yet but imperfectly
understood, in its intentions and probable results, by
the people of the South, and but little appreciated by them.
It has been received in all parts of the country with an undefined
sort of repugnance, a sort of squeamishness, which is
incident to all such violations of moral prejudices, and invariably
wears off on familiarity with the subject. The South will
commence by enduring, and end by embracing the project."<a name="FNanchor_6_642" id="FNanchor_6_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_642" class="fnanchor">6</a>
The matter being now fully before the public through these
motions, Governor Adams's message, and newspaper and
pamphlet discussion, the radical party pushed the project with
all energy.</p>


<p>82. <b>Commercial Conventions of 1857&ndash;58.</b> The first piece
of regular business that came before the Commercial Convention
at Knoxville, Tennessee, August 10, 1857, was a proposal
to recommend the abrogation of the 8th Article of the Treaty
of Washington, on the slave-trade. An amendment offered by
Sneed of Tennessee, declaring it inexpedient and against settled
policy to reopen the trade, was voted down, Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina,
and Virginia refusing to agree to it. The original motion then
passed; and the radicals, satisfied with their success in the first
skirmish, again secured the appointment of a committee to
report at the next meeting on the subject of reopening the
slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_7_643" id="FNanchor_7_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_643" class="fnanchor">7</a> This next meeting assembled May 10, 1858, in a
Gulf State, Alabama, in the city of Montgomery. Spratt of<!-- Page 171 --><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>
South Carolina, the slave-trade champion, presented an elaborate
majority report from the committee, and recommended
the following resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That slavery is right, and that being right, there can be
no wrong in the natural means to its formation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Resolved</i>, That it is expedient and proper that the foreign slave
trade should be re-opened, and that this Convention will lend its
influence to any legitimate measure to that end.</p>

<p>3. <i>Resolved</i>, That a committee, consisting of one from each slave
State, be appointed to consider of the means, consistent with the
duty and obligations of these States, for re-opening the foreign
slave-trade, and that they report their plan to the next meeting of
this Convention.</p>
</div>

<p>Yancey, from the same committee, presented a minority report,
which, though it demanded the repeal of the national
prohibitory laws, did not advocate the reopening of the trade
by the States.</p>

<p>Much debate ensued. Pryor of Virginia declared the majority
report "a proposition to dissolve the Union." Yancey
declared that "he was for disunion now. [Applause.]" He defended
the principle of the slave-trade, and said: "If it is right
to buy slaves in Virginia and carry them to New Orleans, why
is it not right to buy them in Cuba, Brazil, or Africa, and
carry them there?" The opposing speeches made little attempt
to meet this uncomfortable logic; but, nevertheless, opposition
enough was developed to lay the report on the table until
the next convention, with orders that it be printed, in the
mean time, as a radical campaign document. Finally the convention
passed a resolution:&mdash;</p>

<p>That it is inexpedient for any State, or its citizens, to attempt to
re-open the African slave-trade while that State is one of the United
States of America.<a name="FNanchor_8_644" id="FNanchor_8_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_644" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>83. <b>Commercial Convention of 1859.</b> The Convention of
1859 met at Vicksburg, Mississippi, May 9&ndash;19, and the slave-trade
party came ready for a fray. On the second day Spratt
called up his resolutions, and the next day the Committee on
Resolutions recommended that, <i>"in the opinion of this Convention,
all laws, State or Federal, prohibiting the African slave
trade, ought to be repealed."</i> Two minority reports accompanied
this resolution: one proposed to postpone action, on account
of the futility of the attempt at that time; the other
report recommended that, since repeal of the national laws
was improbable, nullification by the States impracticable, and
action by the Supreme Court unlikely, therefore the States
should bring in the Africans as apprentices, a system the legality
of which "is incontrovertible." "The only difficult question,"
it was said, "is the future status of the apprentices after
the expiration of their term of servitude."<a name="FNanchor_9_645" id="FNanchor_9_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_645" class="fnanchor">9</a> Debate on these
propositions began in the afternoon. A brilliant speech on the
resumption of the importation of slaves, says Foote of Mississippi,
"was listened to with breathless attention and applauded
vociferously. Those of us who rose in opposition
were looked upon by the excited assemblage present as <i>traitors</i>
to the best interests of the South, and only worthy of
expulsion from the body. The excitement at last grew so high
that personal violence was menaced, and some dozen of the
more conservative members of the convention withdrew from
the hall in which it was holding its sittings."<a name="FNanchor_10_646" id="FNanchor_10_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_646" class="fnanchor">10</a> "It was clear,"
adds De Bow, "that the people of Vicksburg looked upon it
[i.e., the convention] with some distrust."<a name="FNanchor_11_647" id="FNanchor_11_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_647" class="fnanchor">11</a> When at last a
ballot was taken, the first resolution passed by a vote of 40 to

again condemned; and it was also suggested, in the newspaper
which was the official organ of the meeting, that "the
Convention raise a fund to be dispensed in premiums for the
best sermons in favor of reopening the African Slave Trade."<a name="FNanchor_13_649" id="FNanchor_13_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_649" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>84. <b>Public Opinion in the South.</b> This record of the Commercial
Conventions probably gives a true reflection of the
development of extreme opinion on the question of reopening
the slave-trade. First, it is noticeable that on this point
there was a distinct divergence of opinion and interest between
the Gulf and the Border States, and it was this more
than any moral repugnance that checked the radicals. The
whole movement represented the economic revolt of the
slave-consuming cotton-belt against their base of labor supply.
This revolt was only prevented from gaining its ultimate
end by the fact that the Gulf States could not get on without
the active political co-operation of the Border States. Thus,
although such hot-heads as Spratt were not able, even as late
as 1859, to carry a substantial majority of the South with them
in an attempt to reopen the trade at all hazards, yet the agitation
did succeed in sweeping away nearly all theoretical opposition
to the trade, and left the majority of Southern people
in an attitude which regarded the reopening of the African
slave-trade as merely a question of expediency.</p>

<p>This growth of Southern opinion is clearly to be followed
in the newspapers and pamphlets of the day, in Congress, and
in many significant movements. The Charleston <i>Standard</i> in
a series of articles strongly advocated the reopening of the
trade; the Richmond <i>Examiner</i>, though opposing the scheme
as a Virginia paper should, was brought to "acknowledge that
the laws which condemn the Slave-trade imply an aspersion
upon the character of the South.<a name="FNanchor_14_650" id="FNanchor_14_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_650" class="fnanchor">14</a>
<!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">174</span>
In March, 1859, the <i>National Era</i> said: "There can be no doubt that the idea of reviving
the African Slave Trade is gaining ground in the South.
Some two months ago we could quote strong articles from
ultra Southern journals against the traffic; but of late we have
been sorry to observe in the same journals an ominous silence
upon the subject, while the advocates of 'free trade in negroes'
are earnest and active."<a name="FNanchor_15_651" id="FNanchor_15_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_651" class="fnanchor">15</a> The Savannah <i>Republican</i>, which at
first declared the movement to be of no serious intent, conceded,
in 1859, that it was gaining favor, and that nine-tenths
of the Democratic Congressional Convention favored it, and
that even those who did not advocate a revival demanded the
abolition of the laws.<a name="FNanchor_16_652" id="FNanchor_16_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_652" class="fnanchor">16</a> A correspondent from South Carolina
writes, December 18, 1859: "The nefarious project of opening
it [i.e., the slave trade] has been started here in that prurient
temper of the times which manifests itself in disunion
schemes.... My State is strangely and terribly infected with
all this sort of thing.... One feeling that gives a countenance
to the opening of the slave trade is, that it will be a
sort of spite to the North and defiance of their opinions."<a name="FNanchor_17_653" id="FNanchor_17_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_653" class="fnanchor">17</a>
The New Orleans <i>Delta</i> declared that those who voted for
the slave-trade in Congress were men "whose names will be
honored hereafter for the unflinching manner in which they
stood up for principle, for truth, and consistency, as well as
the vital interests of the South."<a name="FNanchor_18_654" id="FNanchor_18_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_654" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>85. <b>The Question in Congress.</b> Early in December, 1856,
the subject reached Congress; and although the agitation was
then new, fifty-seven Southern Congressmen refused to declare
a re-opening of the slave-trade "shocking to the moral
sentiment of the enlightened portion of mankind," and eight
refused to call the reopening even "unwise" and "inexpedient."<a name="FNanchor_19_655" id="FNanchor_19_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_655" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Three years later, January 31, 1859, it was impossible,<!-- Page 175 --><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>
in a House of one hundred and ninety-nine members, to get
a two-thirds vote in order even to consider Kilgore's resolutions,
which declared "that no legislation can be too thorough
in its measures, nor can any penalty known to the catalogue
of modern punishment for crime be too severe against a
traffic so inhuman and unchristian."<a name="FNanchor_20_656" id="FNanchor_20_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_656" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

States."<a name="FNanchor_27_663" id="FNanchor_27_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_663" class="fnanchor">27</a> Jefferson Davis strongly denied "any coincidence of
opinion with those who prate of the inhumanity and sinfulness
of the trade. The interest of Mississippi," said he, "not
of the African, dictates my conclusion." He opposed the immediate
reopening of the trade in Mississippi for fear of a
paralyzing influx of Negroes, but carefully added: "This conclusion,
in relation to Mississippi, is based upon my view of<!-- Page 176 --><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>
her <i>present</i> condition, <i>not</i> upon any <i>general theory</i>. It is not

John Forsyth, who for seven years conducted the slave-trade
diplomacy of the nation, declared, about 1860: "But one
stronghold of its [i.e., slavery's] enemies remains to be carried,
to <i>complete its triumph</i> and assure its welfare,&mdash;that is
the existing prohibition of the African Slave-trade."<a name="FNanchor_29_665" id="FNanchor_29_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_665" class="fnanchor">29</a> Pollard,
in his <i>Black Diamonds</i>, urged the importation of Africans as
"laborers." "This I grant you," said he, "would be practically
the re-opening of the African slave trade; but ... you will
find that it very often becomes necessary to evade the letter
of the law, in some of the greatest measures of social happiness
and patriotism."<a name="FNanchor_30_666" id="FNanchor_30_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_666" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>


<p>86. <b>Southern Policy in 1860.</b> The matter did not rest with
mere words. During the session of the Vicksburg Convention,
an "African Labor Supply Association" was formed, under
the presidency of J.D.B. De Bow, editor of <i>De Bow's
Review</i>, and ex-superintendent of the seventh census. The object
of the association was "to promote the supply of African
labor."<a name="FNanchor_31_667" id="FNanchor_31_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_667" class="fnanchor">31</a> In 1857 the committee of the South Carolina legislature
to whom the Governor's slave-trade message was referred
made an elaborate report, which declared in italics:
<i>"The South at large does need a re-opening of the African slave
trade."</i> Pettigrew, the only member who disagreed to this report,
failed of re-election. The report contained an extensive
argument to prove the kingship of cotton, the perfidy of English
philanthropy, and the lack of slaves in the South, which,
it was said, would show a deficit of six hundred thousand
slaves by 1878.<a name="FNanchor_32_668" id="FNanchor_32_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_668" class="fnanchor">32</a> In Georgia, about this time, an attempt to
expunge the slave-trade prohibition in the State Constitution
lacked but one vote of passing.<a name="FNanchor_33_669" id="FNanchor_33_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_669" class="fnanchor">33</a> From these slower and more
legal movements came others less justifiable. The long argument
<!-- Page 177 --><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">177</span>on the "apprentice" system finally brought a request to
the collector of the port at Charleston, South Carolina, from
E. Lafitte &amp; Co., for a clearance to Africa for the purpose of
importing African "emigrants." The collector appealed to the
Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb of Georgia, who
flatly refused to take the bait, and replied that if the "emigrants"
were brought in as slaves, it would be contrary to
United States law; if as freemen, it would be contrary to their
own State law.<a name="FNanchor_34_670" id="FNanchor_34_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_670" class="fnanchor">34</a> In Louisiana a still more radical movement
was attempted, and a bill passed the House of Representatives
authorizing a company to import two thousand five hundred
Africans, "indentured" for fifteen years "at least." The bill
lacked but two votes of passing the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_35_671" id="FNanchor_35_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_671" class="fnanchor">35</a> It was said that
the <i>Georgian</i>, of Savannah, contained a notice of an agricultural
society which "unanimously resolved to offer a premium
of $25 for the best specimen of a live African imported into
the United States within the last twelve months."<a name="FNanchor_36_672" id="FNanchor_36_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_672" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>It would not be true to say that there was in the South in
1860 substantial unanimity on the subject of reopening the
slave-trade; nevertheless, there certainly was a large and influential
minority, including perhaps a majority of citizens of the
Gulf States, who favored the project, and, in defiance of law
and morals, aided and abetted its actual realization. Various
movements, it must be remembered, gained much of their
strength from the fact that their success meant a partial nullification
of the slave-trade laws. The admission of Texas added
probably seventy-five thousand recently imported slaves to the
Southern stock; the movement against Cuba, which culminated
in the "Ostend Manifesto" of Buchanan, Mason, and
Soul&eacute;, had its chief impetus in the thousands of slaves whom
Americans had poured into the island. Finally, the series of
filibustering expeditions against Cuba, Mexico, and Central
America were but the wilder and more irresponsible attempts
to secure both slave territory and slaves.</p>

<p>87. <b>Increase of the Slave-Trade from 1850 to 1860.</b> The
long and open agitation for the reopening of the slave-trade,
together with the fact that the South had been more or less
familiar with violations of the laws since 1808, led to such a
remarkable increase of illicit traffic and actual importations in
the decade 1850&ndash;1860, that the movement may almost be
termed a reopening of the slave-trade.</p>

<p>In the foreign slave-trade our own officers continue to report
"how shamefully our flag has been used;"<a name="FNanchor_37_673" id="FNanchor_37_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_673" class="fnanchor">37</a> and British
officers write "that at least one half of the successful part of
the slave trade is carried on under the American flag," and
this because "the number of American cruisers on the station
is so small, in proportion to the immense extent of the slave-dealing
coast."<a name="FNanchor_38_674" id="FNanchor_38_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_674" class="fnanchor">38</a> The fitting out of slavers became a flourishing
business in the United States, and centred at New York City.
"Few of our readers," writes a periodical of the day, "are
aware of the extent to which this infernal traffic is carried on,
by vessels clearing from New York, and in close alliance with
our legitimate trade; and that down-town merchants of
wealth and respectability are extensively engaged in buying
and selling African Negroes, and have been, with comparatively
little interruption, for an indefinite number of years."<a name="FNanchor_39_675" id="FNanchor_39_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_675" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Another periodical says: "The number of persons engaged in
the slave-trade, and the amount of capital embarked in it, exceed
our powers of calculation. The city of New York has
been until of late [1862] the principal port of the world for
this infamous commerce; although the cities of Portland and
Boston are only second to her in that distinction. Slave dealers
added largely to the wealth of our commercial metropolis;
they contributed liberally to the treasuries of political organizations,
and their bank accounts were largely depleted to
carry elections in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut."<a name="FNanchor_40_676" id="FNanchor_40_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_676" class="fnanchor">40</a>
During eighteen months of the years 1859&mdash;1860 eighty-five
slavers are reported to have been fitted out in New Yo<!-- Page 179 --><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>rk
harbor,<a name="FNanchor_41_677" id="FNanchor_41_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_677" class="fnanchor">41</a> and these alone transported from 30,000 to 60,000
slaves annually.<a name="FNanchor_42_678" id="FNanchor_42_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_678" class="fnanchor">42</a> The United States deputy marshal of that
district declared in 1856 that the business of fitting out slavers
"was never prosecuted with greater energy than at present.
The occasional interposition of the legal authorities exercises
no apparent influence for its suppression. It is seldom that
one or more vessels cannot be designated at the wharves, respecting
which there is evidence that she is either in or has
been concerned in the Traffic."<a name="FNanchor_43_679" id="FNanchor_43_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_679" class="fnanchor">43</a> On the coast of Africa "it is
a well-known fact that most of the Slave ships which visit the
river are sent from New York and New Orleans."<a name="FNanchor_44_680" id="FNanchor_44_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_680" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The absence of United States war-ships at the Brazilian station
enabled American smugglers to run in cargoes, in spite
of the prohibitory law. One cargo of five hundred slaves was
landed in 1852, and the <i>Correio Mercantil</i> regrets "that it was
the flag of the United States which covered this act of piracy,
sustained by citizens of that great nation."<a name="FNanchor_45_681" id="FNanchor_45_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_681" class="fnanchor">45</a> When the Brazil
trade declined, the illicit Cuban trade greatly increased, and
the British consul reported: "Almost all the slave expeditions
for some time past have been fitted out in the United States,
chiefly at New York."<a name="FNanchor_46_682" id="FNanchor_46_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_682" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>88. <b>Notorious Infractions of the Laws.</b> This decade is especially
noteworthy for the great increase of illegal importations
into the South. These became bold, frequent, and
notorious. Systematic introduction on a considerable scale
probably commenced in the forties, although with great secrecy.
"To have boldly ventured into New Orleans, with negroes
freshly imported from Africa, would not only have
brought down upon the head of the importer the vengeance
<!-- Page 180 --><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">180</span>of our very philanthropic Uncle Sam, but also the anathemas
of the whole sect of philanthropists and negrophilists everywhere.
To import them for years, however, into quiet places,
evading with impunity the penalty of the law, and the ranting
of the thin-skinned sympathizers with Africa, was gradually
to popularize the traffic by creating a demand for laborers,
and thus to pave the way for the <i>gradual revival of the slave
trade</i>. To this end, a few men, bold and energetic, determined,
ten or twelve years ago [1848 or 1850], to commence the business
of importing negroes, slowly at first, but surely; and for
this purpose they selected a few secluded places on the coast
of Florida, Georgia and Texas, for the purpose of concealing
their stock until it could be sold out. Without specifying
other places, let me draw your attention to a deep and abrupt
pocket or indentation in the coast of Texas, about thirty miles
from Brazos Santiago. Into this pocket a slaver could run at
any hour of the night, because there was no hindrance at the
entrance, and here she could discharge her cargo of movables
upon the projecting bluff, and again proceed to sea inside of
three hours. The live stock thus landed could be marched a
short distance across the main island, over a porous soil which
refuses to retain the recent foot-prints, until they were again
placed in boats, and were concealed upon some of the innumerable
little islands which thicken on the waters of the Laguna
in the rear. These islands, being covered with a thick
growth of bushes and grass, offer an inscrutable hiding place
for the 'black diamonds.'"<a name="FNanchor_47_683" id="FNanchor_47_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_683" class="fnanchor">47</a> These methods became, however,
toward 1860, too slow for the radicals, and the trade grew
more defiant and open. The yacht "Wanderer," arrested on
suspicion in New York and released, landed in Georgia six
months later four hundred and twenty slaves, who were never
recovered.<a name="FNanchor_48_684" id="FNanchor_48_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_684" class="fnanchor">48</a> The Augusta <i>Despatch</i> says: "Citizens of our city

is the third cargo landed by the same company, during the
last six months."<a name="FNanchor_49_685" id="FNanchor_49_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_685" class="fnanchor">49</a> Two parties of Africans were brought into

landed a cargo of slaves, was seized on the Florida coast;
another vessel was reported to be landing slaves near Mobile;
a letter from Jacksonville, Florida, stated that a bark had left
there for Africa to ship a cargo for Florida and Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_50_686" id="FNanchor_50_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_686" class="fnanchor">50</a> Stephen
A. Douglas said "that there was not the shadow of

for a long time back, and that there had been more
Slaves imported into the southern States, during the last year,
than had ever been imported before in any one year, even
when the Slave-trade was legal. It was his confident belief,
that over fifteen thousand Slaves had been brought into this
country during the past year [1859.] He had seen, with his
own eyes, three hundred of those recently-imported, miserable
beings, in a Slave-pen in Vicksburg, Miss., and also large
numbers at Memphis, Tenn."<a name="FNanchor_51_687" id="FNanchor_51_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_687" class="fnanchor">51</a> It was currently reported that
depots for these slaves existed in over twenty large cities and
towns in the South, and an interested person boasted to a
senator, about 1860, that "twelve vessels would discharge their
living freight upon our shores within ninety days from the 1st
of June last," and that between sixty and seventy cargoes had
been successfully introduced in the last eighteen months.<a name="FNanchor_52_688" id="FNanchor_52_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_688" class="fnanchor">52</a>
The New York <i>Tribune</i> doubted the statement; but John C.
Underwood, formerly of Virginia, wrote to the paper saying
that he was satisfied that the correspondent was correct. "I
have," he said, "had ample evidences of the fact, that reopening
the African Slave-trade is a thing already accomplished,
and the traffic is brisk, and rapidly increasing. In fact, the
most vital question of the day is not the opening of this trade,
but its suppression. The arrival of cargoes of negroes, fresh
from Africa, in our southern ports, is an event of frequent
occurrence."<a name="FNanchor_53_689" id="FNanchor_53_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_689" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Negroes, newly landed, were openly advertised for sale in
the public press, and bids for additional importations made.
In reply to one of these, the Mobile <i>Mercury</i> facetiously remarks:

from the American Missionary Society recited the fact that
"this piratical and illegal trade&mdash;this inhuman invasion of the
rights of men,&mdash;this outrage on civilization and Christianity&mdash;this
violation of the laws of God and man&mdash;is openly
countenanced and encouraged by a portion of the citizens of
some of the States of this Union."<a name="FNanchor_56_692" id="FNanchor_56_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_692" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>From such evidence it seems clear that the slave-trade laws,
in spite of the efforts of the government, in spite even of
much opposition to these extra-legal methods in the South
itself, were grossly violated, if not nearly nullified, in the latter
part of the decade 1850&ndash;1860.</p>


<p>89. <b>Apathy of the Federal Government.</b> During the decade
there was some attempt at reactionary legislation, chiefly
directed at the Treaty of Washington. June 13, 1854, Slidell,
from the Committee on Foreign Relations, made an elaborate
report to the Senate, advocating the abrogation of the 8th
Article of that treaty, on the ground that it was costly, fatal
to the health of the sailors, and useless, as the trade had actually
<!-- Page 183 --><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>increased under its operation.<a name="FNanchor_57_693" id="FNanchor_57_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_693" class="fnanchor">57</a> Both this and a similar
attempt in the House failed,<a name="FNanchor_58_694" id="FNanchor_58_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_694" class="fnanchor">58</a> as did also an attempt to substitute
life imprisonment for the death penalty.<a name="FNanchor_59_695" id="FNanchor_59_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_695" class="fnanchor">59</a> Most of the
actual legislation naturally took the form of appropriations.
In 1853 there was an attempt to appropriate $20,000.<a name="FNanchor_60_696" id="FNanchor_60_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_696" class="fnanchor">60</a> This
failed, and the appropriation of $8,000 in 1856 was the first
for ten years.<a name="FNanchor_61_697" id="FNanchor_61_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_697" class="fnanchor">61</a> The following year brought a similar appropriation,<a name="FNanchor_62_698" id="FNanchor_62_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_698" class="fnanchor">62</a>
and in 1859<a name="FNanchor_63_699" id="FNanchor_63_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_699" class="fnanchor">63</a> and 1860<a name="FNanchor_64_700" id="FNanchor_64_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_700" class="fnanchor">64</a> $75,000 and $40,000 respectively
were appropriated. Of attempted legislation
to strengthen the laws there was plenty: e.g., propositions to
regulate the issue of sea-letters and the use of our flag;<a name="FNanchor_65_701" id="FNanchor_65_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_701" class="fnanchor">65</a> to
prevent the "coolie" trade, or the bringing in of "apprentices"
or "African laborers;"<a name="FNanchor_66_702" id="FNanchor_66_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_702" class="fnanchor">66</a> to stop the coastwise trade;<a name="FNanchor_67_703" id="FNanchor_67_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_703" class="fnanchor">67</a> to assent
to a Right of Search;<a name="FNanchor_68_704" id="FNanchor_68_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_704" class="fnanchor">68</a> and to amend the Constitution
by forever prohibiting the slave-trade.<a name="FNanchor_69_705" id="FNanchor_69_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_705" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The efforts of the executive during this period were criminally
lax and negligent. "The General Government did not<!-- Page 184 --><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>
exert itself in good faith to carry out either its treaty stipulations
or the legislation of Congress in regard to the matter.
If a vessel was captured, her owners were permitted to bond
her, and thus continue her in the trade; and if any man was
convicted of this form of piracy, the executive always interposed
between him and the penalty of his crime. The laws
providing for the seizure of vessels engaged in the traffic
were so constructed as to render the duty unremunerative;
and marshals now find their fees for such services to be actually
less than their necessary expenses. No one who bears
this fact in mind will be surprised at the great indifference of
these officers to the continuing of the slave-trade; in fact, he
will be ready to learn that the laws of Congress upon the
subject had become a dead letter, and that the suspicion was
well grounded that certain officers of the Federal Government
had actually connived at their violation."<a name="FNanchor_70_706" id="FNanchor_70_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_706" class="fnanchor">70</a> From 1845 to
1854, in spite of the well-known activity of the trade, but five
cases obtained cognizance in the New York district. Of
these, Captains Mansfield and Driscoll forfeited their bonds
of $5,000 each, and escaped; in the case of the notorious
Canot, nothing had been done as late as 1856, although he
was arrested in 1847; Captain Jefferson turned State's evidence,
and, in the case of Captain Mathew, a <i>nolle prosequi</i>
was entered.<a name="FNanchor_71_707" id="FNanchor_71_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_707" class="fnanchor">71</a> Between 1854 and 1856 thirty-two persons were
indicted in New York, of whom only thirteen had at the latter
date been tried, and only one of these convicted.<a name="FNanchor_72_708" id="FNanchor_72_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_708" class="fnanchor">72</a> These
dismissals were seldom on account of insufficient evidence.
In the notorious case of the "Wanderer," she was arrested on
suspicion, released, and soon after she landed a cargo of
slaves in Georgia; some who attempted to seize the Negroes
were arrested for larceny, and in spite of the efforts of Congress
the captain was never punished. The yacht was afterwards
started on another voyage, and being brought back to
Boston was sold to her former owner for about one third
her value.<a name="FNanchor_73_709" id="FNanchor_73_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_709" class="fnanchor">73</a> The bark "Emily" was seized on suspicion and
<!-- Page 185 --><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>released, and finally caught red-handed on the coast of Africa;
she was sent to New York for trial, but "disappeared"
under a certain slave captain, Townsend, who had, previous
to this, in the face of the most convincing evidence, been acquitted
at Key West.<a name="FNanchor_74_710" id="FNanchor_74_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_710" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The squadron commanders of this time were by no means
as efficient as their predecessors, and spent much of their
time, apparently, in discussing the Right of Search. Instead
of a number of small light vessels, which by the reports of
experts were repeatedly shown to be the only efficient craft,
the government, until 1859, persisted in sending out three or
four great frigates. Even these did not attend faithfully to
their duties. A letter from on board one of them shows that,
out of a fifteen months' alleged service, only twenty-two days
were spent on the usual cruising-ground for slavers, and thirteen
of these at anchor; eleven months were spent at Madeira
and Cape Verde Islands, 300 miles from the coast and 3,000
miles from the slave market.<a name="FNanchor_75_711" id="FNanchor_75_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_711" class="fnanchor">75</a> British commanders report the
apathy of American officers and the extreme caution of their
instructions, which allowed many slavers to escape.<a name="FNanchor_76_712" id="FNanchor_76_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_712" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>The officials at Washington often remained in blissful, and
perhaps willing, ignorance of the state of the trade. While
Americans were smuggling slaves by the thousands into Brazil,
and by the hundreds into the United States, Secretary
Graham was recommending the abrogation of the 8th Article
of the Treaty of Washington;<a name="FNanchor_77_713" id="FNanchor_77_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_713" class="fnanchor">77</a> so, too, when the Cuban slave-trade
was reaching unprecedented activity, and while slavers
were being fitted out in every port on the Atlantic seaboard,
Secretary Kennedy na&iuml;vely reports, "The time has come, perhaps,
when it may be properly commended to the notice of
Congress to inquire into the necessity of further continuing
the regular employment of a squadron on this [i.e., the
African] coast."<a name="FNanchor_78_714" id="FNanchor_78_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_714" class="fnanchor">78</a> Again, in 1855, the government has<!-- Page 186 --><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">186</span> "advices
that the slave trade south of the equator is entirely broken
up;"<a name="FNanchor_79_715" id="FNanchor_79_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_715" class="fnanchor">79</a> in 1856, the reports are "favorable;"<a name="FNanchor_80_716" id="FNanchor_80_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_716" class="fnanchor">80</a> in 1857 a British
commander writes: "No vessel has been seen here for one
year, certainly; I think for nearly three years there have been
no American cruizers on these waters, where a valuable and
extensive American commerce is carried on. I cannot, therefore,
but think that this continued absence of foreign cruizers
looks as if they were intentionally withdrawn, and as if the
Government did not care to take measures to prevent the
American flag being used to cover Slave Trade transactions;"<a name="FNanchor_81_717" id="FNanchor_81_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_717" class="fnanchor">81</a>
nevertheless, in this same year, according to Secretary Toucey,
"the force on the coast of Africa has fully accomplished its
main object."<a name="FNanchor_82_718" id="FNanchor_82_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_718" class="fnanchor">82</a> Finally, in the same month in which the "Wanderer"
and her mates were openly landing cargoes in the
South, President Buchanan, who seems to have been utterly
devoid of a sense of humor, was urging the annexation of
Cuba to the United States as the only method of suppressing
the slave-trade!<a name="FNanchor_83_719" id="FNanchor_83_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_719" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>About 1859 the frequent and notorious violations of our
laws aroused even the Buchanan government; a larger appropriation
was obtained, swift light steamers were employed,
and, though we may well doubt whether after such a carnival
illegal importations "entirely" ceased, as the President informed
Congress,<a name="FNanchor_84_720" id="FNanchor_84_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_720" class="fnanchor">84</a> yet some sincere efforts at suppression
were certainly begun. From 1850 to 1859 we have few notices
of captured slavers, but in 1860 the increased appropriation of
the thirty-fifth Congress resulted in the capture of twelve vessels
with 3,119 Africans.<a name="FNanchor_85_721" id="FNanchor_85_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_721" class="fnanchor">85</a> The Act of June 16, 1860, enabled the<!-- Page 187 --><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>
President to contract with the Colonization Society for the
return of recaptured Africans; and by a long-needed arrangement
cruisers were to proceed direct to Africa with such cargoes,
instead of first landing them in this country.<a name="FNanchor_86_722" id="FNanchor_86_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_722" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>


<p>90. <b>Attitude of the Southern Confederacy.</b> The attempt,
initiated by the constitutional fathers, to separate the problem
of slavery from that of the slave-trade had, after a trial of half
a century, signally failed, and for well-defined economic reasons.
The nation had at last come to the parting of the ways,
one of which led to a free-labor system, the other to a slave
system fed by the slave-trade. Both sections of the country
naturally hesitated at the cross-roads: the North clung to the
delusion that a territorially limited system of slavery, without
a slave-trade, was still possible in the South; the South hesitated
to fight for her logical object&mdash;slavery and free trade in
Negroes&mdash;and, in her moral and economic dilemma, sought
to make autonomy and the Constitution her object. The real
line of contention was, however, fixed by years of development,
and was unalterable by the present whims or wishes of
the contestants, no matter how important or interesting these
might be: the triumph of the North meant free labor; the
triumph of the South meant slavery and the slave-trade.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if many of the Southern leaders ever deceived
themselves by thinking that Southern slavery, as it then was,
could long be maintained without a general or a partial reopening
of the slave-trade. Many had openly declared this a
few years before, and there was no reason for a change of
opinion. Nevertheless, at the outbreak of actual war and
secession, there were powerful and decisive reasons for relegating
the question temporarily to the rear. In the first place,
only by this means could the adherence of important Border
States be secured, without the aid of which secession was
folly. Secondly, while it did no harm to laud the independence
of the South and the kingship of cotton in "stump"
speeches and conventions, yet, when it came to actual hostilities,
the South sorely needed the aid of Europe; and this a
nation fighting for slavery and the slave-trade stood poor
chance of getting. Consequently, after attacking the slave-trade
<!-- Page 188 --><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>laws for a decade, and their execution for a quarter-century,
we find the Southern leaders inserting, in both the
provisional and the permanent Constitutions of the Confederate
States, the following article:&mdash;</p>

<p>The importation of negroes of the African race, from any foreign
country other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the
United States of America, is hereby forbidden; and Congress is required
to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the same.</p>

<p>Congress shall also have power to prohibit the introduction of
slaves from any State not a member of, or Territory not belonging
to, this Confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_87_723" id="FNanchor_87_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_723" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>The attitude of the Confederate government toward this
article is best illustrated by its circular of instructions to its
foreign ministers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It has been suggested to this Government, from a source of unquestioned
authenticity, that, after the recognition of our independence
by the European Powers, an expectation is generally
entertained by them that in our treaties of amity and commerce a
clause will be introduced making stipulations against the African
slave trade. It is even thought that neutral Powers may be inclined
to insist upon the insertion of such a clause as a <i>sine qua non</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>You are well aware how firmly fixed in our Constitution is the
policy of this Confederacy against the opening of that trade, but we
are informed that false and insidious suggestions have been made by
the agents of the United States at European Courts of our intention
to change our constitution as soon as peace is restored, and of authorizing
the importation of slaves from Africa. If, therefore, you
should find, in your intercourse with the Cabinet to which you are
accredited, that any such impressions are entertained, you will use
every proper effort to remove them, and if an attempt is made to
introduce into any treaty which you may be charged with negotiating
stipulations on the subject just mentioned, you will assume, in
behalf of your Government, the position which, under the direction
of the President, I now proceed to develop.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the Confederate States is an agreement made
between independent States. By its terms all the powers of Government
are separated into classes as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st. Such powers as the States delegate to the General Government.</p>
<p><!-- Page 189 --><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum">189</span></p>
<p>2d. Such powers as the States agree to refrain from exercising,
although they do not delegate them to the General Government.</p>

<p>3d. Such powers as the States, without delegating them to the
General Government, thought proper to exercise by direct agreement
between themselves contained in the Constitution.</p>

<p>4th. All remaining powers of sovereignty, which not being delegated
to the Confederate States by the Constitution nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the
people thereof.... Especially in relation to the importation of African
negroes was it deemed important by the States that no power
to permit it should exist in the Confederate Government.... It
will thus be seen that no power is delegated to the Confederate Government
over this subject, but that it is included in the third class
above referred to, of powers exercised directly by the States....
This Government unequivocally and absolutely denies its possession
of any power whatever over the subject, and cannot entertain any
proposition in relation to it.... The policy of the Confederacy is
as fixed and immutable on this subject as the imperfection of human
nature permits human resolve to be. No additional agreements, treaties,
or stipulations can commit these States to the prohibition of the
African slave trade with more binding efficacy than those they have
themselves devised. A just and generous confidence in their good
faith on this subject exhibited by friendly Powers will be far more
efficacious than persistent efforts to induce this Government to assume
the exercise of powers which it does not possess.... We
trust, therefore, that no unnecessary discussions on this matter will
be introduced into your negotiations. If, unfortunately, this reliance
should prove ill-founded, you will decline continuing negotiations
on your side, and transfer them to us at home....<a name="FNanchor_88_724" id="FNanchor_88_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_724" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>
</div>

<p>This attitude of the conservative leaders of the South, if it
meant anything, meant that individual State action could,
when it pleased, reopen the slave-trade. The radicals were, of
course, not satisfied with any veiling of the ulterior purpose
of the new slave republic, and attacked the constitutional provision
violently. "If," said one, "the clause be carried into the<!-- Page 190 --><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">190</span>
permanent government, our whole movement is defeated. It
will abolitionize the Border Slave States&mdash;it will brand our
institution. Slavery cannot share a government with Democracy,&mdash;it
cannot bear a brand upon it; thence another revolution
... having achieved one revolution to escape
democracy at the North, it must still achieve another to escape
it at the South. That it will ultimately triumph none can
doubt."<a name="FNanchor_89_725" id="FNanchor_89_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_725" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>91. <b>Attitude of the United States.</b> In the North, with all
the hesitation in many matters, there existed unanimity in regard
to the slave-trade; and the new Lincoln government ushered
in the new policy of uncompromising suppression by
hanging the first American slave-trader who ever suffered the
extreme penalty of the law.<a name="FNanchor_90_726" id="FNanchor_90_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_726" class="fnanchor">90</a> One of the earliest acts of President
Lincoln was a step which had been necessary since 1808,
but had never been taken, viz., the unification of the whole
work of suppression into the hands of one responsible department.
By an order, dated May 2, 1861, Caleb B. Smith,
Secretary of the Interior, was charged with the execution of
the slave-trade laws,<a name="FNanchor_91_727" id="FNanchor_91_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_727" class="fnanchor">91</a> and he immediately began energetic
work. Early in 1861, as soon as the withdrawal of the Southern
members untied the hands of Congress, two appropriations
of $900,000 each were made to suppress the slave trade, the
first appropriations commensurate with the vastness of the
task. These were followed by four appropriations of $17,000
each in the years 1863 to 1867, and two of $12,500 each in 1868
and 1869.<a name="FNanchor_92_728" id="FNanchor_92_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_728" class="fnanchor">92</a> The first work of the new secretary was to obtain
a corps of efficient assistants. To this end, he assembled all the
marshals of the loyal seaboard States at New York, and gave
them instruction and opportunity to inspect actual slavers.
<!-- Page 191 --><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum">191</span>Congress also, for the first time, offered them proper compensation.<a name="FNanchor_93_729" id="FNanchor_93_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_729" class="fnanchor">93</a>
The next six months showed the effect of this policy
in the fact that five vessels were seized and condemned,
and four slave-traders were convicted and suffered the penalty
of their crimes. "This is probably the largest number [of convictions]
ever obtained, and certainly the only ones for many
years."<a name="FNanchor_94_730" id="FNanchor_94_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_730" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Meantime the government opened negotiations with Great
Britain, and the treaty of 1862 was signed June 7, and carried
out by Act of Congress, July 11.<a name="FNanchor_95_731" id="FNanchor_95_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_731" class="fnanchor">95</a> Specially commissioned war
vessels of either government were by this agreement authorized
to search merchant vessels on the high seas and specified
coasts, and if they were found to be slavers, or, on account of
their construction or equipment, were suspected to be such,
they were to be sent for condemnation to one of the mixed
courts established at New York, Sierra Leone, and the Cape
of Good Hope. These courts, consisting of one judge and one
arbitrator on the part of each government, were to judge the
facts without appeal, and upon condemnation by them, the
culprits were to be punished according to the laws of their
respective countries. The area in which this Right of Search
could be exercised was somewhat enlarged by an additional
article to the treaty, signed in 1863. In 1870 the mixed courts
were abolished, but the main part of the treaty was left in
force. The Act of July 17, 1862, enabled the President to contract
with foreign governments for the apprenticing of recaptured
Africans in the West Indies,<a name="FNanchor_96_732" id="FNanchor_96_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_732" class="fnanchor">96</a> and in 1864 the coastwise
slave-trade was forever prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_97_733" id="FNanchor_97_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_733" class="fnanchor">97</a> By these measures the
trade was soon checked, and before the end of the war entirely
suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_98_734" id="FNanchor_98_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_734" class="fnanchor">98</a> The vigilance of the government, however,
was not checked, and as late as 1866 a squadron of ten ships,
with one hundred and thirteen guns, patrolled the slave
<!-- Page 192 --><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum">192</span>coast.<a name="FNanchor_99_735" id="FNanchor_99_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_735" class="fnanchor">99</a> Finally, the Thirteenth Amendment legally confirmed
what the war had already accomplished, and slavery and the
slave-trade fell at one blow.<a name="FNanchor_100_736" id="FNanchor_100_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_736" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>92. <b>How the Question Arose.</b> We have followed a chapter
of history which is of peculiar interest to the sociologist. Here
was a rich new land, the wealth of which was to be had in
return for ordinary manual labor. Had the country been conceived
of as existing primarily for the benefit of its actual
inhabitants, it might have waited for natural increase or immigration
to supply the needed hands; but both Europe and
the earlier colonists themselves regarded this land as existing
chiefly for the benefit of Europe, and as designed to be exploited,
as rapidly and ruthlessly as possible, of the boundless
wealth of its resources. This was the primary excuse for the
rise of the African slave-trade to America.</p>

<p>Every experiment of such a kind, however, where the moral
standard of a people is lowered for the sake of a material advantage,
is dangerous in just such proportion as that advantage
is great. In this case it was great. For at least a century,
in the West Indies and the southern United States, agriculture
flourished, trade increased, and English manufactures were
nourished, in just such proportion as Americans stole Negroes
and worked them to death. This advantage, to be sure,
became much smaller in later times, and at one critical period
was, at least in the Southern States, almost <i>nil</i>; but energetic
efforts were wanting, and, before the nation was aware, slavery
had seized a new and well-nigh immovable footing in the
Cotton Kingdom.</p>

<p>The colonists averred with perfect truth that they did not
commence this fatal traffic, but that it was imposed upon
them from without. Nevertheless, all too soon did they lay
aside scruples against it and hasten to share its material
benefits. Even those who braved the rough Atlantic for the
highest moral motives fell early victims to the allurements of
<!-- Page 194 --><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">194</span>this system. Thus, throughout colonial history, in spite of
many honest attempts to stop the further pursuit of the slave-trade,
we notice back of nearly all such attempts a certain
moral apathy, an indisposition to attack the evil with the
sharp weapons which its nature demanded. Consequently,
there developed steadily, irresistibly, a vast social problem,
which required two centuries and a half for a nation of
trained European stock and boasted moral fibre to solve.</p>


<p>93. <b>The Moral Movement.</b> For the solution of this problem
there were, roughly speaking, three classes of efforts
made during this time,&mdash;moral, political, and economic: that
is to say, efforts which sought directly to raise the moral standard
of the nation; efforts which sought to stop the trade by
legal enactment; efforts which sought to neutralize the economic
advantages of the slave-trade. There is always a certain
glamour about the idea of a nation rising up to crush an evil
simply because it is wrong. Unfortunately, this can seldom be
realized in real life; for the very existence of the evil usually
argues a moral weakness in the very place where extraordinary
moral strength is called for. This was the case in the early
history of the colonies; and experience proved that an appeal
to moral rectitude was unheard in Carolina when rice had
become a great crop, and in Massachusetts when the rum-slave-traffic
was paying a profit of 100%. That the various abolition
societies and anti-slavery movements did heroic work
in rousing the national conscience is certainly true; unfortunately,
however, these movements were weakest at the most
critical times. When, in 1774 and 1804, the material advantages
of the slave-trade and the institution of slavery were least, it
seemed possible that moral suasion might accomplish the abolition
of both. A fatal spirit of temporizing, however, seized
the nation at these points; and although the slave-trade was,
largely for political reasons, forbidden, slavery was left untouched.
Beyond this point, as years rolled by, it was found
well-nigh impossible to rouse the moral sense of the nation.
Even in the matter of enforcing its own laws and co-operating
with the civilized world, a lethargy seized the country, and it
did not awake until slavery was about to destroy it. Even
then, after a long and earnest crusade, the national sense of
right did not rise to the entire abolition of slavery. It was only
<!-- Page 195 --><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>a peculiar and almost fortuitous commingling of moral, political,
and economic motives that eventually crushed African
slavery and its handmaid, the slave-trade in America.</p>


<p>94. <b>The Political Movement.</b> The political efforts to limit
the slave-trade were the outcome partly of moral reprobation
of the trade, partly of motives of expediency. This legislation
was never such as wise and powerful rulers may make for a
nation, with the ulterior purpose of calling in the respect
which the nation has for law to aid in raising its standard of
right. The colonial and national laws on the slave-trade
merely registered, from time to time, the average public opinion
concerning this traffic, and are therefore to be regarded
as negative signs rather than as positive efforts. These signs
were, from one point of view, evidences of moral awakening;
they indicated slow, steady development of the idea that to
steal even Negroes was wrong. From another point of view,
these laws showed the fear of servile insurrection and the desire
to ward off danger from the State; again, they often indicated
a desire to appear well before the civilized world, and
to rid the "land of the free" of the paradox of slavery. Representing
such motives, the laws varied all the way from mere
regulating acts to absolute prohibitions. On the whole, these
acts were poorly conceived, loosely drawn, and wretchedly
enforced. The systematic violation of the provisions of many
of them led to a widespread belief that enforcement was, in
the nature of the case, impossible; and thus, instead of marking
ground already won, they were too often sources of distinct
moral deterioration. Certainly the carnival of lawlessness
that succeeded the Act of 1807, and that which preceded final
suppression in 1861, were glaring examples of the failure of
the efforts to suppress the slave-trade by mere law.</p>


<p>95. <b>The Economic Movement.</b> Economic measures against
the trade were those which from the beginning had the best
chance of success, but which were least tried. They included
tariff measures; efforts to encourage the immigration of free
laborers and the emigration of the slaves; measures for changing
the character of Southern industry; and, finally, plans to
restore the economic balance which slavery destroyed, by raising
the condition of the slave to that of complete freedom
and responsibility. Like the political efforts, these rested in
<!-- Page 196 --><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">196</span>part on a moral basis; and, as legal enactments, they were also
themselves often political measures. They differed, however,
from purely moral and political efforts, in having as a main
motive the economic gain which a substitution of free for
slave labor promised.</p>

<p>The simplest form of such efforts was the revenue duty on
slaves that existed in all the colonies. This developed into the
prohibitive tariff, and into measures encouraging immigration
or industrial improvements. The colonization movement was
another form of these efforts; it was inadequately conceived,
and not altogether sincere, but it had a sound, although in
this case impracticable, economic basis. The one great measure
which finally stopped the slave-trade forever was, naturally,
the abolition of slavery, i.e., the giving to the Negro
the right to sell his labor at a price consistent with his own
welfare. The abolition of slavery itself, while due in part to
direct moral appeal and political sagacity, was largely the
result of the economic collapse of the large-farming slave
system.</p>


<p>96. <b>The Lesson for Americans.</b> It may be doubted if ever
before such political mistakes as the slavery compromises of
the Constitutional Convention had such serious results, and
yet, by a succession of unexpected accidents, still left a nation
in position to work out its destiny. No American can study
the connection of slavery with United States history, and not
devoutly pray that his country may never have a similar social
problem to solve, until it shows more capacity for such work
than it has shown in the past. It is neither profitable nor in
accordance with scientific truth to consider that whatever the
constitutional fathers did was right, or that slavery was a
plague sent from God and fated to be eliminated in due time.
We must face the fact that this problem arose principally from
the cupidity and carelessness of our ancestors. It was the plain
duty of the colonies to crush the trade and the system in its
infancy: they preferred to enrich themselves on its profits. It
was the plain duty of a Revolution based upon "Liberty" to
take steps toward the abolition of slavery: it preferred promises
to straightforward action. It was the plain duty of the
Constitutional Convention, in founding a new nation, to
compromise with a threatening social evil only in case its settlement
<!-- Page 197 --><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>would thereby be postponed to a more favorable
time: this was not the case in the slavery and the slave-trade
compromises; there never was a time in the history of America
when the system had a slighter economic, political, and
moral justification than in 1787; and yet with this real, existent,
growing evil before their eyes, a bargain largely of
dollars and cents was allowed to open the highway that led
straight to the Civil War. Moreover, it was due to no wisdom
and foresight on the part of the fathers that fortuitous circumstances
made the result of that war what it was, nor was it
due to exceptional philanthropy on the part of their descendants
that that result included the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>With the faith of the nation broken at the very outset, the
system of slavery untouched, and twenty years' respite given
to the slave-trade to feed and foster it, there began, with 1787,
that system of bargaining, truckling, and compromising with
a moral, political, and economic monstrosity, which makes
the history of our dealing with slavery in the first half of the
nineteenth century so discreditable to a great people. Each
generation sought to shift its load upon the next, and the
burden rolled on, until a generation came which was both too
weak and too strong to bear it longer. One cannot, to be
sure, demand of whole nations exceptional moral foresight
and heroism; but a certain hard common-sense in facing the
complicated phenomena of political life must be expected in
every progressive people. In some respects we as a nation
seem to lack this; we have the somewhat inchoate idea that
we are not destined to be harassed with great social questions,
and that even if we are, and fail to answer them, the fault is
with the question and not with us. Consequently we often
congratulate ourselves more on getting rid of a problem than
on solving it. Such an attitude is dangerous; we have and
shall have, as other peoples have had, critical, momentous,
and pressing questions to answer. The riddle of the Sphinx
may be postponed, it may be evasively answered now; sometime
it must be fully answered.</p>

<p>It behooves the United States, therefore, in the interest
both of scientific truth and of future social reform, carefully
to study such chapters of her history as that of the suppression
of the slave-trade. The most obvious question which this<!-- Page 198 --><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">198</span>
study suggests is: How far in a State can a recognized moral
wrong safely be compromised? And although this chapter of
history can give us no definite answer suited to the ever-varying
aspects of political life, yet it would seem to warn any
nation from allowing, through carelessness and moral cowardice,
any social evil to grow. No persons would have seen
the Civil War with more surprise and horror than the Revolutionists
of 1776; yet from the small and apparently dying
institution of their day arose the walled and castled Slave-Power.
From this we may conclude that it behooves nations
as well as men to do things at the very moment when they
ought to be done.</p>

<p class="atext">"The United States having been the first to abolish,
within the extent of their authority, the transportation
of the natives of Africa into slavery, by
prohibiting the introduction of slaves, and by
punishing their citizens participating in the traffick,
cannot but be gratified at the progress,
made by concurrent efforts of other nations, towards
a general suppression of so great an evil.
They must feel, at the same time, the greater solicitude
to give the fullest efficacy to their own
regulations. With that view, the interposition of
Congress appears to be required by the violations
and evasions which, it is suggested, are chargeable
on unworthy citizens, who mingle in the
slave trade under foreign flags, and with foreign
ports; and by collusive importations of slaves
into the United States, through adjoining ports
and territories. I present the subject to Congress,
with a full assurance of their disposition to apply
all the remedy which can be afforded by an
amendment of the law. The regulations which
<!-- Page 256 --><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>were intended to guard against abuses of a
kindred character, in the trade between the several

<p class="atext">Adams, March 31, proposes that the trade be made piracy.
Canning, April 8, reminds Adams of the
treaty of Ghent and asks for the granting of a mutual
Right of Search to suppress the slave-trade.
The matter is further discussed until June 24.
Minister Rush is empowered to propose a treaty
involving the Right of Search, etc. This treaty was
substantially the one signed (see below, March 13,
1824), differing principally in the first article.</p>

<p class="atext">"Article I. The two high contracting Powers, having
each separately, by its own laws, subjected their
subjects and citizens, who may be convicted of
carrying on the illicit traffic in slaves on the coast
of Africa, to the penalties of piracy, do hereby
agree to use their influence, respectively, with the
other maritime and civilized nations of the world,
to the end that the said African slave trade may

<p class="atext">"The Convention:"&mdash;</p>

<p class="atext">Art. I. "The commanders and commissioned officers of
each of the two high contracting parties, duly authorized,
under the regulations and instructions
of their respective Governments, to cruize on the
coasts of Africa, of America, and of the West Indies,
for the suppression of the slave trade," shall
have the power to seize and bring into port any
vessel owned by subjects of the two contracting
parties, found engaging in the slave-trade. The
vessel shall be taken for trial to the country where
she belongs.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. II. Provides that even if the vessel seized does not
belong to a citizen or citizens of either of the two
contracting parties, but is chartered by them, she
may be seized in the same way as if she belonged
to them.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. III. Requires that in all cases where any vessel of
either party shall be boarded by any naval officer
of the other party, on suspicion of being concerned
in the slave-trade, the officer shall deliver
to the captain of the vessel so boarded a certificate
in writing, signed by the naval officer, specifying
his rank, etc., and the object of his visit. Provision
is made for the delivery of ships and papers to the
<!-- Page 267 --><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>tribunal before which they are brought.</p>
<p class="pagenum">267</p>

<p class="atext">Art. IV. Limits the Right of Search, recognized by the
Convention, to such investigation as shall be necessary
to ascertain the fact whether the said vessel
is or is not engaged in the slave-trade. No person
shall be taken out of the vessel so visited unless
for reasons of health.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. V. Makes it the duty of the commander of either
nation, having captured a vessel of the other under
the treaty, to receive unto his custody the vessel
captured, and send or carry it into some port
of the vessel's own country for adjudication, in
which case triplicate declarations are to be signed,
etc.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. VI. Provides that in cases of capture by the officer
of either party, on a station where no national
vessel is cruising, the captor shall either send or
carry his prize to some convenient port of its own
country for adjudication, etc.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. VII. Provides that the commander and crew of
the captured vessel shall be proceeded against as
pirates, in the ports to which they are brought,
etc.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. VIII. Confines the Right of Search, under this
treaty, to such officers of both parties as are
especially authorized to execute the laws of their
countries in regard to the slave-trade. For every
abusive exercise of this right, officers are to be
personally liable in costs and damages, etc.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. IX. Provides that the government of either nation
shall inquire into abuses of this Convention and
of the laws of the two countries, and inflict on
guilty officers the proper punishment.</p>

<p class="atext">Art. X. Declares that the right, reciprocally conceded
by this treaty, is wholly and exclusively founded
on the consideration that the two nations have by
their laws made the slave-trade piracy, and is not
to be taken to affect in any other way the rights
of the parties, etc.; it further engages that each
power shall use its influence with all other civilized
<!-- Page 268 --><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>powers, to procure from them the acknowledgment
that the slave-trade is piracy under the
law of nations.</p><p class="pagenum">268</p>

<p class="atext">Art. XI. Provides that the ratifications of the treaty
shall be exchanged at London within twelve
months, or as much sooner as possible. Signed by
Mr. Rush, Minister to the Court of St. James,
March 13, 1824.</p>

<p class="atext">The above is a synopsis of the treaty as it was laid
before the Senate. It was ratified by the Senate
with certain conditions, one of which was that the
duration of this treaty should be limited to the
pleasure of the two parties on six months' notice;
another was that the Right of Search should be
limited to the African and West Indian seas: i.e.,
the word "America" was struck out. This treaty as
amended and passed by the Senate (cf. above,
p. 141) was rejected by Great Britain. A counter
project was suggested by her, but not accepted (cf.
above, p. 144). The striking out of the word
"America" was declared to be the insuperable objection.

<p class="atext">"It is a cause of serious regret, that no arrangement
has yet been finally concluded between the two
Governments, to secure, by joint co-operation,
the suppression of the slave trade. It was the object
of the British Government, in the early stages
of the negotiation, to adopt a plan for the
suppression, which should include the concession
of the mutual right of search by the ships of war
of each party, of the vessels of the other, for suspected
<!-- Page 270 --><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>offenders. This was objected to by this
Government, on the principle that, as the right of
search was a right of war of a belligerant towards
a neutral power, it might have an ill effect to extend
it, by treaty, to an offence which had been
made comparatively mild, to a time of peace. Anxious,
however, for the suppression of this trade, it
was thought adviseable, in compliance with a resolution
of the House of Representatives, founded
on an act of Congress, to propose to the British
Government an expedient, which should be free
from that objection, and more effectual for the
object, by making it piratical.... A convention
to this effect was concluded and signed, in London,"
on the 13th of March, 1824, "by plenipotentiaries
duly authorized by both Governments, to
the ratification of which certain obstacles have
arisen, which are not yet entirely removed." [For
the removal of which, the documents relating to
the negotiation are submitted for the action of
Congress]....</p>

<p class="atext">"In execution of the laws for the suppression of the
slave trade, a vessel has been occasionally sent
from that squadron to the coast of Africa, with
orders to return thence by the usual track of the
slave ships, and to seize any of our vessels which
might be engaged in that trade. None have been
found, and, it is believed, that none are thus employed.
It is well known, however, that the trade
still exists under other flags." <i>House Journal</i>, 18

with the United States.</p>

<p class="atext">British and French ministers simultaneously invited
the United States to accede to the Convention just
concluded between them for the suppression of
the slave-trade. The Secretary of State, Mr.
M'Lane, deferred answer until the meeting of
Congress, and then postponed negotiations on account
of the irritable state of the country on the
slave question. Great Britain had proposed that
"A reciprocal right of search ... be conceded by
the United States, limited as to place, and subject
to specified restrictions. It is to be employed only
in repressing the Slave Trade, and to be exercised
under a written and specific authority, conferred
on the Commander of the visiting ship." In the
act of accession, "it will be necessary that the right
of search should be extended to the coasts of the
United States," and Great Britain will in turn extend
it to the British West Indies. This proposal
was finally refused, March 24, 1834, chiefly, as

the participants to exercise the Right of Search
denied by the United States, or to make a change
in the hitherto recognized law of nations, he, on
his own responsibility, addressed the following

<p class="atext">"<span class="smcap">Legation of the United States,
"Paris, February 13, 1842</span>.</p>

<p class="atext">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The recent signature of a treaty, having for its
object the suppression of the African slave trade,
by five of the powers of Europe, and to which
France is a party, is a fact of such general notoriety
that it may be assumed as the basis of any
diplomatic representations which the subject may
fairly require."</p>

<p class="atext">The United States is no party to this treaty. She denies
the Right of Visitation which England asserts.
[Quotes from the presidential message of Dec. 7,
1841.] This principle is asserted by the treaty.</p>

<p class="atext">" ... The moral effect which such a union of five
great powers, two of which are eminently maritime,
but three of which have perhaps never had
a vessel engaged in that traffic, is calculated to
produce upon the United States, and upon other
nations who, like them, may be indisposed to
these combined movements, though it may be regretted,
yet furnishes no just cause of complaint.
But the subject assumes another aspect when they
are told by one of the parties that their vessels are
to be forcibly entered and examined, in order to
carry into effect these stipulations. Certainly the
American Government does not believe that the
high powers, contracting parties to this treaty,
have any wish to compel the United States, by
force, to adopt their measures to its provisions, or
to adopt its stipulations ...; and they will see
with pleasure the prompt disavowal made by
yourself, sir, in the name of your country, ... of
any intentions of this nature. But were it otherwise, ...
They would prepare themselves with
apprehension, indeed, but without dismay&mdash;with

them by the British authorities, most solemnly declare

<p class="pagenum">290</p>
<p class="atext">"It is apprehended that the opening of this trade [<i>i.e.</i>,
the slave-trade] will lessen the value of slaves, and
ultimately destroy the institution. It is a sufficient
answer to point to the fact, that unrestricted immigration
has not diminished the value of labor
in the Northwestern section of the confederacy.
The cry there is, want of labor, notwithstanding
capital has the pauperism of the old world to
press into its grinding service. If we cannot supply
the demand for slave labor, then we must expect
<!-- Page 290 --><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>to be supplied with a species of labor we do not
want, and which is, from the very nature of
things, antagonistic to our institutions. It is much
better that our drays should be driven by slaves&mdash;that
our factories should be worked by slaves&mdash;that
our hotels should be served by slaves&mdash;that
our locomotives should be manned by slaves, than
that we should be exposed to the introduction,
from any quarter, of a population alien to us by
birth, training, and education, and which, in the
process of time, must lead to that conflict between
capital and labor, 'which makes it so difficult to
maintain free institutions in all wealthy and highly
civilized nations where such institutions as ours
do not exist.' In all slaveholding States, true policy
dictates that the superior race should direct, and
the inferior perform all menial service. Competition
between the white and black man for this service,
may not disturb Northern sensibility, but it
does not exactly suit our latitude." <i>South Carolina

civilized world where the African slave trade is
tolerated; and we are bound by treaty with Great
Britain to maintain a naval force on the coast of
Africa, at much expense both of life and treasure,
solely for the purpose of arresting slavers bound
to that island. The late serious difficulties between
the United States and Great Britain respecting the
right of search, now so happily terminated, could
never have arisen if Cuba had not afforded a market
for slaves. As long as this market shall remain

benighted Africa....</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
